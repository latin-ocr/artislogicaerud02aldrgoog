to conceive it as such that two straight lines cannot

perfect attempt to describe in general terms what is
known much more clearly by the image. Ιι may serve
to lead the thoughts of the leamer to the proper image3
but it was itseli founded on a previous image in the
mind of the teacher; and if the definition and the image
differ, the former is in fault, not the latter.

lIl. This brings us ιο our third theory, which is that
maintained by Kant. According to this theory, the
fundamental assumptione of Geometry ere Proper Asicius,
or synthetical judgments a priori ,· and the possibility of
forming such judgments depends ou the power of oon·
structiug the objeots to which they refer in a pure
intuition, i. e. in an intuition containing no adventitious
clement external to the mind itself. The'images of
geometrice] figures differ from all others in being, not
represented modificatione of body, but presented modi-
ficatione of space; and the universal validity of the
synthetical judgments is a consequence of the universal
presence of space es the form οῖ’ every possible per-
ception of body.

Three of these synthetical judgments are given in the
loth, llth, and reth axioms of Euclid ; and either these
cr other axioma analogous to these must be assumed as
erident by intuition, before any or' the properties or'
more complex figures can be made lrnown ‘by demon·
stration. I dc not say that Euclid has given the best
and simplest forms of these axioms, but that in some
form or other they are indispensable. To regard all
such axioms aa possibly demonstrable theorems is to be
ignorant of the logical conditione under which demon-
stration is possible; for a synthetical judgment ia de·
