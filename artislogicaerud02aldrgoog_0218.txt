⁸ The examination of Fallacies ie extralogieul, except when
the consequence is formally invalid3 in which cese it may be
detected by the ordinary rules of eyllogIsm. 'I'he following
Sophisms ere not sll susceptible of this solution. They ure
mostly material fallacies, srising from ambiguity of lengusge
or fulsity of assertion. But they are not treated of by Aristotle
as belonging ιο the Scienco of Logic, but ιο the Art of Die·
lectic, of which, ashes been before observed, e considerable
portion is material In feet, Aristotle's Treatise περὶ σοφιστικῶν
ἐλέγχον is merely an account of the pseudo-refutatione prin-
cipally in use smoug the Sophiste of his day, whether depend-
' ing upon equivoeal lauguage, falso assumption, or illogical
reasoning. In relation ιο Logic, ithae little more then a
historical value. Α strictly logical classitication of fallseies
should commence by distinguishing‚ in sll the three operatione
of thought, between the matter which is given to, sud the serm
which is given hythe thinking act. Acte of conception, judg·
ment, or reasoning which violate the lews of thought, and ere
therefore defective in form, should he elessed as logical fal-
lscies; those which are fsulty in the 'conditione preliminary
ιο the act of thought should be classed as material. See
