applied ιο another. Thus lar Mr. Mill's position is
unquestiouably true; but l thiulr it may he shown to be
not itself the fundamental assumption ol Geometry, but
a consequence derivable from a higher assumption.

The existence is clearly only that which is implied in
the possible construction of the figure. Tus actual or
possible existence in nature of a body so figured is not
once appealed ιο in the demonstration‚ and might be
denied without allecting its validity. The Postulate,
therelore, implica the possible construction of a figure,
such as is contemplated iu the proposition.

But this construction is mental, not manual. The
figure aa drawn upon paper is only a representative ol
the figure as imagined by the mind, and might be dis·
pensed with altogether it the latter could be kept before
us with sufficient stendiness. This brings us to Ka'nt's
principle of the possibility ol mathematical seleuce, viz.
the power of constructinp the objects or' its concepts3
i. e. of presenting them a priori in epure intuition.

But how is this construction itself possible, and what
conditione is it required ιο lulfil? Mr. Mill regards it
as only possible a posteriori, and as subject to the same
conditione as an objectos sense. He says, “ tbe points,
lines, circlos, aud squama, which any one has in his
mind, are simply copies of the points, lines, circlos, and

equares which he has known in bis experience. We
cau reason about a line esis it had no breadth; but we
cannot conceive a line without breadtb‘.” This is true;
but the author is mistalren in supposing such a oon·
ception ιο be necessary ιο establish the o priori character

of Mathematics. The true Postulats is not that οἰ tho
possible existence of an object corresponding ιο the
definitior, but of one fulfilling the conditione of the

proper mom. We are not required to conceive a
