lt is not denied that there are passages in Aristotle
which may seem ιο conulenance this interpretation; but
there are others so palpably inconsistent with it that
we are compelled ιο sealt for a new explanation ol the
former.

ln the first place, Aristotle distinctly condemns the
assumption of Definitions aa a Petilio Principio, a charge
ιο which the above example is obviously liable; the real
question ιο be proved being, that the three-sided figure
hae its angles equal ιο two right angles, whether it is
called a triangle or not. In the second place, he says
that Demonstration proceeds from animur, and cites
aa a specimen ol the latter, “ If equale be taken from
equale, the remainders are equal¹.’' These axioma,
he says, are common ιο many classes of objects3 but,
in any single Science, need only be assumed ιο an
extent commensurate with the object-matter of that
Science. The above axiom, for example, is true of
other things besides Geometrical Magnitudes, hut it is
sufficient lor the Geometer to assume it aa true of these
only.

Now is an axium of this kind be the major pramise in
a Demonstration‚ it is manifest that its predicate will
also be the predicate of the Conclusi0n3 and that the
logical form of that conclusion will be, not “All
trianglcs are figures having their angles equal to two
right angles‚” hut, “ Triangles and figures having their
angles equal to two right angles are equal ιο each
other.”

The immediate Syllogism from which thia pro·
position is proved by Euclid‚ may be logically stated
as follows: »
