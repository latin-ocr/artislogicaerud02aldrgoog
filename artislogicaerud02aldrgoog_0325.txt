The true characteres hypothetical reasoning is lost
sight of in the examples commonly selected by Logicians,
which bave ior their subject a proper came, and indicate,
not a general relation of reason and consequent between
two notione, but certain accidental circumstances in the
history of an individual. The adoption of this type has
led ιο the logical anomaly, that the propositions cf a
hypothetical syllogism are generally stated without any
designate quantity ; whereas it is obvious that, wherever
concepta are compared together in any form of reasoning,
two distinct conclusione may follow, according to the
quantity assigned. For example: to the promise, “If men
are wisa, they will consult their permanent interosts,”
we may supply two minora and oonelusions‚ in the con-
stmctire form, according aa we affirm the antecedent ol
all meu or of come. It thus becomes necessary to dis·
tinguish between two different binde of apparent hypo· ⁸
thetical syllogisms; those in which the inierenoe is from
a general hypothesis to all or some of its special
instances, and those in which a relation between two
individual facts is assumed as a hypothesis leading to
a singular conclusion. The former contain a general
relation of determining and determined notion, which
may always be expressed in three terms3 the occasional
employment of four being only an accidental variety of
language. Thus the general assertiou, “ lf any country
is justly genamad, the pcoplc are happy,‘' is equivalent
to, “If any country is justly gevemed, it bas happy
poople.'’ This we may apply to special instances; cll
caturcensem countriea, or tto country, being asserted
to be justly governed: and this is properly hypotheticcl
receoaiay. The latter denote only a material connection
between two single facts, either of which may, to certain
