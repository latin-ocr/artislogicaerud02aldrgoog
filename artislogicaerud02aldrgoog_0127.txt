ll, 16.) Neverthelesa. on the strength 01 a misunderstood
passage in 1110 De Anima, (1. 1. 16.) the thraefold division of
real definition has been fathered on the Stagirite. For a
fuller account of Aristotle's doctrine, see Appendix, 0010 0.
Before quitting this subject, it may be observed, that Logicians
have perpetually confounded 1110 thia-p or oetion within the
mind with the 111090 or individuale without. Thus Abp.
Whately observes, that Logia 10 concemed with nominal-
definitions only; because all that 10 requisita for the purposes
01 reasoning is, that a word shall not be used in different
00000ος a real definition 01 any thing belongs 10 the sciense
or system which 10 employed about that thing· On the
contrary, Logic 10 concerned with recl or 00110001 definitione
only: ita object being 10 produce distinctam in concepta, which
are 1110 111090 01 Logia. Nominal definitione belong to the
grammars or dictionaries of particular languages. Even
Kant (Loyilc, 1. 166.) has not quite avoided 11110 confusion.

011110 Schoolmen were 0110000. The 1101111010, following 1110
Arabiane, divided Logia 1010 two parts; 000, which treated
of the essenos 01 incomplex 0011000 and 'things by definitior:
the other, of the truth of propositione as determined by
arpuocentotioa. To this latter the greater part of 1110101010
telian Logia was regarded as belonging. The former was
supposed 10 have formed a 1001 portion 01 the anc'ient 0010000.
The Nominalista. 00 the other hand, and more correctly, main·
tained that to investigate the 00000000 01 things belonged 10
the province of Metaphysics; the Logician, as such, assigning
no actual definitione, but borrowing them 00 mere exemplos
