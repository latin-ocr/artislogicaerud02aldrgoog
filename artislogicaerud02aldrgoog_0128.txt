et Differentiam ; vel Physica, quae partes Essentiae
physicae, i. e. realiter distinctas: nam Genus et
Differentia'sola mente distinguuntur.

E. g. Definitur homo Nominatum, qui ex humo.

Ρ Phyeical definition ie rejected by Aristotle, (Metaph. vi.
ll.) on the ground that the physioal parte are not parte of the
species, but of the individuale. hidrich'a expression, ‘⁸ partes
amatia physicas.” cannot be tolerated‚ unless we regard univer·
sal notione as not merely real substanees, but corporeal. In
the example given by Aldrich. the aoculled Physical definition
may be regarded as merely an indirect mode of erpreeeing
the same notion that the Metaphyeical definition expresses
directly. It is thua merely an accidental variation ol lan·
guage, easily reduced to the direct form, and is so regarded
by Albert„ de Prffld. Tract. i. chap. d. end by Occam. pti.
oh. 26. In all other casea it ia no definition at all.

t Most Logicians reckon two principal methods of nominel
definition: 1. by a synonymoua term, e. g. “ensis eat gladiose·
2. by Etymology, aa in Aldrich’s example. The former ie in
laet translation, it being indifferent whether the synonyme
belong to the seme language or n0t; the latter will in many
cases be no definition at all; a large number ol worda having
quite lost their etymological meaning. Neither ol these
methode is countenanced by Aristotle; see Appendix, note 0.
'I'he former may be traced to the Greek Commentatom aee
Alexander, in Metaph. p. 442. ed. Bonita. The latter ie an
innovation borrowed from the Rhetoriciana, by whom it was
called Neratio. See Cicero. Top. ch. 8.

“In Mathematice, and in all etrict Sciencee,” says Abp.
Whately‚ “the Nominat and the Real Definition eractly coin-
cide; the waning os tho word, and the arcturo os aaa thing,
being erectly tto ramo.’¹ This remark ie based on Locke;
(Erray, b. iii. c. d. ᾗ. 18.) but it consounds the Roal Ercavica
ol Locke, i. e. the unknown constitution ol each iadicidaol
with the Maubai Erroneam contentens a yooaol oetion Ol.
