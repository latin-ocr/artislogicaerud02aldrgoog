The Definition of Socrates has also more ofa material socratis
than a logical character. He continually distinguishesD‘ffinmn·
between the essence and the qualities of a thing, and
insiste on determining what a thing a, rather than what
it resemble! ,· a distinction afterwards repudiated by his
disciple Antisthenes who dauied the possibility of real
delinition. Bnt Definition, as treated by Socrates, isa
contribution, not to Logia, but to Metaphysios. It does
not analyse by the lews of pure thought the contenta of
a given notion; but endeavours to penetrate the real
essence of thingsl. The same may in some degree be
said of the Aristotelian treatment of Definition in the
Posterior Analytics.

ln the imperfect Socratis Schools, as they are sometimes Socratis
called, Logia, so far as it was cultivated at all, appears to S⁰h⁰⁰¹³'
have gone bach to the frivolities of the Sophiste, instead ·
of advanoing from, or even retaining, the position gained
by Socrates. Το Antisthenes, the founder of the Cynica,
are attributed two theories; the one a direct reversal cl
the tecching ol Socrates; the other au apparent return to
the sensational and verbal standard of Protagoras. Tha
first ol these denied the possibility of ascertaining the
nature of any thing by definitione the second denied
tlte possibility of contradiction, and, by consequence, of

' falsehood'. The captious reasonings of the Sophiste
also appear again, as has been already observed, in the
Megarica School, especially in its later development¹.

From the position constantly assigned to Socrates inmoto.
