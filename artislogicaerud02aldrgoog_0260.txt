of man.

A Lowest Species will be inadmissible, ss it implies
⁸ s notion so complex os to bc incepeble of further
secessions. It is true thet, in the continual formation of
Species, we moy errive st combinatione of attributes not
reslized in Nature, but the olussilicetion ol things is not
the province of the Logioien3 nor bes he s right to con-
clude dpriom' thet tbe field of physicsl resoerch is ex·
heusted, or thot notions now regarded es imeginsry moy
not bereelter be discovered to be real. But whether such
discovery be medo or not, it will not effect the relation
of two notions to esch other. Logio is concerned only
with the necessary relations of concepte in thought.
Evcry concept, being common to s plurslity of objeots‚
is potentislly divisible into lower ones. A logical
lowest species, if such were possible, would be e con-
cept embrecing ull conceivable attributes not condemned
by the lews of thought es contradictory of esch other.
This, ss well ss its opposite,‘the logical highest genus,
or uotion so simplo as to beve no distinctire attributes,
ore mere imaginsry limite, never reached iu sny process
of actual thought'. Α muteriul soienoe moy heve its

under the nmmum penus of magnitudes in space, we find
three infimoe species ol trisngles, the equiletersl, the
isosceles, end the scolene. The geometriool properties
