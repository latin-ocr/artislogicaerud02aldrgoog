Aquinas in Periherm. Lect. l. (tf. Opusc. xlviii. Tract. de Syll.
cap. l. The passage alluded tc by Aquinas is De An. iii. d. 1.
ἡ μὶν οὖν τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νόησις ἐν τούτοις περὶ d οὐκ ἔστι τὸ ψεῦδος·
ἐν cis ce* τὸ ψεῦδος καὶ τὸ ἀληθές, σύνθεσίς res ἤδη νοημάτων ὥσπερ ἔν
ὄντων. Ἀδιοίρετο are either ἀριθμῷ or sidet. Metaph. ix. l. l.
The latter only arc νοητά, the former αἰσθητά. cf. Anal. Post. i.
al. ll.

⁰ Simple hpprehension, in the only sense in which it can
have any connection with Logic, is an operation of Thoupbt,
and is more properly called ‘conception It is necessary to
distinguish Thought, which ia representative, and whose
immediate object is an cotrariae action, gained by comparison
and indifferently applicable to many individuale, irom the
various intuitive faculties, which are presentatioc, and whose
immediate objectis au iadicidaal thing, act, or stete of mind,
existing without or within ourselves. This distinction is
properly psychological, but must he caresully horne in mind
in reference to the logical characteres Thought Afuller
explanation is given in Prolepomeao Lopica, Chap. I.

ὖ Among various intuitive iaculties, it is necessary to dis
tinguish between amaran, Perceptioa, and Iotopiaatioa. The
two former are distinguished by Stewart, Outliaee oj Moral
Philosophy, ς. 15. “ Sanctior expresses merely that change
in the state of the mind which is produced by an impression
upon an organ oi sense ς cf which change we can conceive the
mind to be conscious without any knowledge of externat
objecta. The word Perceptioa expresses the knowledge we
obtain, by means ol our sensatione, os the qualities os matter-3³
