the identity of Thought aud Being in general, the several
identical determinatione of the one and the other. Such
a process is not thought, hut its negaticn. If the Uni·

versa had one consciousnesS, the system might he r

possible; for Thcught and Being are identical only in
and through consciousness. But such universal ocn-
sciousness could not be my consciousuess; and thus
tha Hegelian assumption cannot be grasped by any act
of human thought. On tlte other hand, thought without
consciousness is inconceirable3 since it implies a ue·
gation ol tho one essential characteristic under which
all thought is presented to the human mind. The logical
notion which is not a sanction of my own personal
thought, is a inere empty abstractim, inconceirable by

reason3 and the system deduoed from it is incompatible η
with those regulatire truths that are above reason. 3

Vulgar Rationalism subjecta belief to thought3 it has
been reserved sor Transcendontal Philosophy to subject
it tc the annihilation of thought.

Speculative philosophy has had three great periods,
each ol which has been consummated by a critical
system of which Formal Logic hasbeen a constituent
portion. The Eleatic and Platonis metaphysica found
their consummatiou in Aristotle3 the Scholastic Philo·
sophy in Occam3 that cf the serenteeuth aud eighteenth
cerituries in Kant. But from the Kantion philosophy
has arisen another phase ol speculati0u‚ not less dogmatis
in its positions, not less extravagant in its aims, not less
uustable in its foundations. Α criticism which shall sift
thoroughly the pratensions of this philosophy, it remains
· for the present generatiou to acoomplish.
