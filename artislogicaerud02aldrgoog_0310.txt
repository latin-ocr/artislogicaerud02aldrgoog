to reduoe Indnotion to Syllogisrn‚ in tho striot sense
of the term, most oommenoe by inverting the whole
operation3 steting es s preliminsry assumption thst
ehieh is reelly the oonolnsion of the Induotive prooess.
It moreover leaves ns no alternative between eonverting
mere empirios] jndgments into seli-evident exioms, or
destroying the vvhole foundstion of ressoning‚ by oom-
menoing vvith s Syllogism whose promises themselves
must be proved by enother Syllogism‚ end so on od
definitum. .

The Aristotelian Indnotion proper hes been desoribed
ss en analytica& its oounterpert, Syllogisrn, es o vyn-
tlsstr'eal prooess3 end the tvvo heve respeotively been
identified with the λόγοι tel τὰς ἀςχὰςωιά o'rrd reio ἀρχῶν
of Aristotlel. And this is in one sense eorreot though,
sooording to o various notion of whole end pert, the
terme Anelysis end Synthesis heve perpetuslly been
interohonged with eeeh other. Aooording es vve look to
the comprehensim, or to the extensiones the notione, we
moy regerd the Genus es e pert of the Species, or the
Species ss e pert of the Genus. Henoe the notione of
Synthesis end Anolysis', of the oompositioo oi ports into
evvhole, end the resolution of s whole into perte, will,
ss we odopt the one or the other point of vievv, be
inserted. We hove previously spoken of lnduotion es
sn inferenoe from the eonstitnting ports to the oon-
stitnted whole. In this respect it is epulationi, the perte
end whole being viewed in their loyiool or oetsmionol
relotion. In the seme point of vievv, the Pletonio
methodos division is sometimes oslled enslytiosl ¹. On
