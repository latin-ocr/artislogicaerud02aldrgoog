disobey the rules os architecture. ln every art or
science, in every inquiry speculative or practical, the
existence os the objeets of inquiry is preaupposed. The
astronomcr is not required to create the heavens, nor
the grammarian ιο supply rulcs oi speech ιο the mute
Quas, nor the logician to analyse the lavvs of thought
where no act oi thought can be attempted.

Thought is representation its primary materials ars'
prosectota'oar, either of the external or the intercal sense.
In the product of any aot of thought, it is necessary to
distinguish between the matter and the serm. The
former is all that is given ont of and prior to the
thinking act; the latter is all thetis conveyed in and
hythe act iactr. To conception are pineo attributes}
to judgment are picen concepts; to reasoning arc pineo
judgments By the aot of conceiving, the attributes are
thought as representing one or more objects; by the act
of judging‚ the concepts are tirouylrt as related ιο one or
more common objects3 by the act of reasoning, the
judgarents are thought as necessitating another judgment
as their consequence.

The thinking process itself may also be distinguished
as material or formal. lt is formal when the matter
given is sufficient for the completior ol the product,
without any other addition thau what is communicated
in the act of thought itself. It is material when the
data are insufficiens aud the mind has consequently to
go out oi the thinking aot to obtain additional materiale.
tf, sor example, having given ιο me the attributes A, B, Ο,
Icao think those attributes as coexisting in an object,
without appsaling ιο experience ιο discover what objects
actually possess them, this is formal coaodniog. lt,
