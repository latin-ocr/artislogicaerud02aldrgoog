the principle of superposition may be applied: but even
here it adds nothing to their evidence. Magnitudes
gisen as the sums of equal magnitudes are ipro scoto
thought as equal; and ιο have recourse ιο super·

necessity testing on the lawa of thought with that of

Muoh error and confusion on this subject might
heve been avoided, had modern philosophers obscrved
Aristotle’s distinction between ἀρχαὶ ἐξ ὦν, or assumptions
from which we resson, and ἁρχαὶ angl ὅ, or assumptione
about the objecta of our ressoniog. ln the former class
he rightly places the axioms; in the latter, the delinitione.
But the true distinction between the axioms proper
and the delinitione, ss synthetioel and analytioal judg-
ments‚ has not, 1 think, been as yet accurately carried
out in reference to Geometry.

The ahove remarks were written aa an appendix to
a pamphlet of mine on the Limite of Demonstrative
Scienoe, published in 1853. ln the remainder of this
note, Ι propose to resume a question which was then
only partislly considered, and to point out what appears
ιο be the' chief deficicncy in the logical arrangement of
geometrioal principles.

Plato asserted that mathematioel demonstration was
founded on hypotheses( Aristotle in lilre manner enu-
meratos hypotheses, along with delinitione, among the
proper principles of sciencef. By this term both philo-
sophers appear to have meant the same thing; namely,
that the recl existence of the objecta of demonstration is
not proved, hot supposed. If there exist any where
