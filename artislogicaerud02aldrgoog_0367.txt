As regards the truth or falsehood of J udgmentS, Logio
properly takes cognisance of F ormal Trutb or F alsehood
only, which depende on tbe agreement or disagreement
of athought with its own laws. Material Trutb‚ which
is sometimes defined as consisting in the agreement of
the thought with its object, might be more correctly
explained as consisting in the agreement of the object
aa represented in thought with the object as presented
in intuition; for the object existe, relatirely to us,
only as giren in some form of intuition. But, however
it may be defined, it is manifest that no general lavv
or criterion of material truth aud falsehood can be
given; for the essence of such trutb consiste in its
adapting itself in every ease to the diversities of this or
that special presentationi. To enumerate in detail all
tbe various sources of material falsehood would be
impossible3 1 bave eontented myself with referring ιο
the three general heads of Mathematical‚ Metapbysioal,
and Physical J udgments3 wbiob appear to possess essen-
tially different degrecs of certainty or impossibility.
These propositions will admit of a different classification,
according to the theories held by different writers as to
their origin. By some, mathematica] judgments will be
clessed with physicul‚ cs due solely to experience: by

others, they will be merged in logical trutlr or falsebood,
as owing their evidence to laws of thought. Metapbysical
judgments, again, will be considered by some as purely
empirical: while by others they will be referred to

rThe error of those philosophers who maintain that colonr cen be
conceived without extension is exposed by Sir W. Hamilton, Βοιὼ wore,
p'‘fifhat a general criterion of material trnth is not only impossible but
sslf-contradicam, is shewn by Ksnt, beytr, Elateituag VII. ⁸
