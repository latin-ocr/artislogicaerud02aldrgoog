as having been maintained by eminent authors in recent
times, and involving views which it is important to a
clear understaudiug of the nature and legitimate oon·
tants oi Logic to distinguish from each other.

According ιο Archbishop Whatcly, Logia may be
defined ns the Science and Artos Reaeouinyi. In this
point oi view, the processes of apprehension and judg-
mantare considered not in themselves aa independent
acts of thought, but as subordinate to argumentation.
“This view,'' says Sir William Hamilcons, “ vvhicb may
be allowed in so lar as it applies ιο tha Logic contained
. ln the Aristotelio treatises now extant was held by
several of the Arabian and Latin Schoolmen3 horrowed
from them by the Oxford Crakanthorpe, it was adopted
by Wallis; and from Wallis it passed to Dr. Whately.
But, as applied to Lugio, in its ovvu nature, this opinion
has been long rejected, ou grounds superfluously oon·
clusire, by the immense majority even of the Peripatetic
dialecticians3 and not a single reason bas been alleged
by Dr. Whately ιο induce us ιο vvaver in our belief, that

‘Iu another passage, Archbishop Whately maintains that Logic is
entirely connnsant obem turgange,- adding, ‘¹ Il any process of reasouing
can talrc place in the mind, without any employment ol language, orally
or mantally, (a metaphysioal question vvhich Ι shall not here discussi
auch a process does not como within the province ol the science'hare
treated ol.'' That languagc iu ita most extended sense, i. e. some system
os signs, verbal or other, is aasential not merely tc tbe communimine,
but to the formation ol thought, appears to be proved by universal expe·

tuitione. But notwithstanding this, language must bo regarded only ns
tha secondury and accidental object ol logio, which is primarily couversaut
about the lava oi thought, not about the instmment by which it is formed
m· communicated. And isany process ol human thought vvere possible
without lauguage, (which Archbishop Whately appears ιο consider as at
least conceivably true) the laves ol such a process would, equally with any
othsr, be maman oi logical investigation. On the question ol the relation
ol lauguage to thought, see Proleyomcna Layica, p. 15.
