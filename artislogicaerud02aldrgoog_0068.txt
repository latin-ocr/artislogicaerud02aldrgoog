ite teaching hy no other examples than algebraical
symbols. Atrectise on Logic is not designed primarily
to gire men facility in the practico oi reasoning‚ any
more than a treatise on Optics is intended to improre
their sight; and it would be as correctior a writer on
the mathematicnl principles of Optics to entitle hia work,
‘⁴ Optics‚ or the art of iinproring defective vision,” es it
is lor a writer on the principles of Logio to adopt for
his title, ‘⁶ Logia, or tho ert of reasoniug.‘’ Yet we do
not therefore deny that a knowledge of Optics is neeful
in making spectaolee, nor that -a knowledge of Logic ie
raluable in the practice of reasoniug.

Art, in the strict oense of the term, is acquired by
practice, Science by studye. Autan who has learnt to
reason accurately by practice in special cases, without
a knowledge ol' the lawe of the syllogism‚ hae the art cf
reasouing‚ bnt not the scieuoe. He who knows the
theory, hut does not practise it, has the science of
reasoning‚ bnt not the art. Τὴο Logic to be found in
treatiees on the subject, i. e. the Loyica decena is thus
clearly a soience and not an art3 sor it is gained hy
study and not hy exercise. But there is afurther dis-
tinction between speculative aud praelicat ecieuce,
according aa the knowledge which it conveys is oon-
aidcred as an end iu ituelf‚ or only as a meatts tc be
applied to some further purposen. And here again,
