off end distinguished from eil others: otherwise it would
not¹be un object, but the universe of ell objeots. In

’ the cot of conception, therefore, when we regerd certain

given attributes as constituting en objectus conceive
it cs thereby limited end sepsreted from ull other
objects‚ us being itsels end nothing else. The indefinite
ideas, therefore, corresponding to the general tenus,
Thing, Objeet, Being in general, ere not concepts, es eon·
teining no distinctius attributes5 end the general object
denoted by such terme is inconceiveble. This lew of
thought is expressed by tbe Principio of Identity,
“ Every A is ᾼ,” cr “Every object cf thought is con-
ceired es itself.”

Attributes which eomply with these leus are logicodly
conceivable; but for en eet of meterisl conception, or
rather of conception combined with perception cr
memory‚ more then this is required. A centem, as hes
before been observed, is logieelly es conceivable es e

horse 3 eud, es mere thoughts, one is es legitimete ns the
other. But the senses or other evidence must further
essure me of the reelity of the objects, before 1 esu
think os either horse or centsur es having sny existence
out of my imeginutien. This assurence is not the result

os e lew of thought, but of s fect of perception. Hence
es e general rulc: all imaginery objects ure conceived
ss such formelly; ell recl objects ere conceived es such
meterielly‚ thetis to say, not by sn set os pure con·
ception, but by uniting thet sot with the presence or
remembrsnce os other sources of information.

Formsl judging is possible, offirmotr'oely, whcnever
one ci the given concepte is contained in the other;
nepoticely, ubenever one of them conuadicts the other.
1r the concepte P end Q heve no attributes in common
or contradicting ench other, 1 cannot determine whether

they coexist in eny object without sn sppeel to expe·
