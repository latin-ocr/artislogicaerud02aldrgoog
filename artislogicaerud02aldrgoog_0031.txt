matters, which a more accurate classifioation of the
sciences would relegare to Metaphysios,·to Psyohology,
to Rhetorio, or to Grammar. But Aristotle must nothe
considered as responsible for the present composition of
the Organon, but only for six distinet treatises, which
his commentators hare combined into one volume‘. Of
these, the latter part of the De [interpretatione and the
Prior Anabptr'ca may he regarded as containing most of
the essential parts of pure Logic; though, as regards the
lans and forms of judgment in some degree, and of
conception almost entirely, much must be added and
much retrenched, before we can bring the entire pro-
ducts of pure thought into harmony nith the elaborate
development of the various forms of the syllogism. Tho
treatise on the catepano, with the early part of the De
Interprctotiooe, is grammatioal rather than logical, with
a fen trespasses on the domuin of Metaphysics3 while
the Posterior Anelytica, together with the Topica and
Sophiatic Resatations‚ contein applicatione of Logic to
necessary and contingent matter in demonstration and
dialectic disputation, and should be accurately classed
rather us parts of the Loyico ntena than of the'Lopr'co
doeens. But we are not justified in criticising the Organon

of Aristorle as though it were a single norlr composed on
a single subject.

Of the post-Aristotelian ngicianS, my limite will only
allow every briefnotioe. To Theophrastus is attributed

the invention of the Hypothetical Syllogism, which was
afterwards more fully developed by Eudemus and tho
