If, on the other hand, a special form ci the copula is
adopted, and Property end Acciderat distinguished by the
expressions A mrest be B, A may he B, the elassifioation
becomes no longer applicable to the pure form of the
proposition, arrd requires the introductiones the extra·
logical doctrine of Medelity‘t The adoption oi a
quantified predicate, on the other hand, is a necessary
step when language is designed to express the pure form
of thought, and every classifioation of logical forms
should be adopted to this condition τ.

ln the foregoing remarlrs, Genus and Definition ex-
press a relation oi notions to notione, Property and
Aecident, one cf attributes to things. Honos it will follow
that notione thought es unreal,i. e. confessedly prediceble
of no objeets existing elsewhere than in the mind, can
only, es such, be the subjecte oi analytieel judgments.

Proper names, on the other hand, having nc essenos, ean
only be the subjecte oi synthetical judgments. The
former have nc Properties or Accidents3 the latter have
no Genus or Definition.

Species is excluded from the Predioables, and confined
to the Species Sabjicibilis, the correlative oi the Predioeble
Genus. By thir we avoid an inconsistency oi which the
majority of Logicians are guilty, in employing the term
Species sometimes to express a relationes a Prodicate
to a Subject, sometimes that of a Subjcet to a Pre-
dicate. The so·called Species Praedicabilia, is, in the
manner of its predication, in no way distinguishable
from Genus. Mon, when predicated oi philosopher,
