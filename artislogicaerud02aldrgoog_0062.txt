was impossible to bring a philosophy of the Absolute
within the received compass os human thought: there
remained only the attempt ιο expand thought tc the
immensity of the object, bya gigantis scheme os Intel-
lectual Pantheism, in which the persona] conscionsnese
aud its limite should be absorbed in the processes of the
oue Infinita Mind. Such is thc fundamental principle
of the Logia of Hegel, a Logio constructed, not in obe-
dience to, but in deficnce of, the lans os thought, which
ere held tube valid only sor the finite understanding
dealing nith finite objects3 the philosophy of the infinite
being based on their abrogation.

Itis not easy to give in a short compass an account of
Hegel’s Logic, which shall be intelligible ιο an English
reader. If we were ιο describe it as an attempt ιο
develope a Philosophy os Being in general, by repro—
ducing the Divine Thought in the act of Orestion, we
might support the view by sufficient quotations from dre
worlr3 but it would courcy an erroneous impression ιο
one who did not bear in mind the total suppressiones
persepolim, divine as well as humen, in the Hegelian
philosophy. It mey perhaps be better characterized as
en illegitimate expansion of thc srmdamental principle
cf the Gartcsian philosophy, modificd in some degree by
the Kantiau. “Cogito, ergo sum” is true within the

Within these limits 'Pbought and Being are identicsl, end

every modification of the one is amodilication of the other.
But il the same principle is to bc accepted in its Hegelisn
extent, Ι must commeuce by escending from my per·
sonal consciousncse ιο a supposed Universal Thought,
identioal with Being in general. Herc personality dis-
