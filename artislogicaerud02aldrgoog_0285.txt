ΟΝ uerterat ANB munau CONSEQUENCE.

A Merserat consequence is defined by Aldricb to be
one in which the conclusion follows from the promises
solely by the force nithe terma. This in fact means,
from some understood Proposition or Propositions, con·
necting the terms, by the addition os which the mind is

enabled tc reduce the consequence to logical forrn. This ⁴

is easily seen, both in Aldrich’s example, “Homo est
animal, Ergo est rivens,” and in the rather more com·

plicated instance given by Sanderson, “Socrates est Ι

risibilis, ergo, Aliquis homo est rationalis.” The latter,
when the necessary conditions are supplied, is expanded
into two syllogisms.

Omne risibile est rationale;
Socrates est risibilis,

Ergo, Socrates est rationalis.
Socrates esthemo,

Ergo, Aliquis homo est rationulis

The failure therefore of a Material consequence takes
place when no such connexion existe between the terme
as will wanaut us in supplying the promises required:
i. e. when one or more of the premises so supplied would
be salae. But to determine this point is obviously
beyond the province of the Logician. For this reason,
Material Consequenoe is rightly excluded from Logia.
Moreover‚ even where true promises can be added,

and the consequence legitimately deduced, we cannot,
except from knowledge of the matter, determine into
what form the reasoning will naturally fall. In soure

cases, as in tho example above quoted from Sanderson,
