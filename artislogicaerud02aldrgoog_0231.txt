Ineptum est hoc Sophisma. 1. Quia solvitur
ambulando; qued iecit Diogenes& 2. Quoniam
ex ipsa Hypothesi, Dum Testudo quae praeoessit

that the iellnoy does not lie in the form, but in the matter.
Thus, representing the whole space to be traversed by a,

⁸· Any space equal ιο 1104- ῑξο -Ι- idi> dc. is infinito, (being
the sum oi an infinite series.) The space ιο be passed before
Achilles overtakes the tortoise is equal to this sum. There
fore itis infinite.”

The whole logical mystery of this famous iollecy lies in
this, that thr major promus is salec. The sum ο1 au infinite
series may be, and in this oase is, finite. This premissis
equally salse, whether space is or is not divisible orl infinitum.
In this wey the sophism is selred by Descartes, Epist. P. I.
Ep. 118. On the metaphysical question connected vvith the
matter of the sophism, see Hegel, Wcrtc, vol. iii. p. 218.

lt may be observed, that hidrich is mistaken as regards

Zeuo’s object in this sophism. It was proposed ιο support
the leading tenet ο1 Parmenides, ο1 the unity ο1 all things, by
shewing that the identity ο1 rest and motion is o necessary
result from the contrary opinion. It does not appear, however,
that Zeno edvanoed this argument seriousiy. His principal
dssign was to retort the ridicule which had been thrown on
the docuine ο1 Parmenides by involving his opponente in
the same absurdities which they professed to find in his
theory. Gi. Plato. Parm. p. 128. Arist. δορὴ. Elcrrch. 10. 1).

5 The solution oi Diogenes proves nothing. Zeno contende
that reason contradicts the evidence oi the seness. Diogenes
replies that the evidence oi the senses contradicts thot oi
reason. Who deniedthat?
