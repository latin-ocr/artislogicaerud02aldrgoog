In the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατον, the proci is of the same
character. It has indeed no special reference to Dialectic,
and is frequently employed in demonstration‘; Aristotle’s
own example being taken from Geometry. But still its
connexion with the original question is not formal, bnt
material; lor we assume,

All A is B;
All (l is A;
Therelore, All 0 is B.

And this conclusion, from material grounds, we lmow to
be false. We also hnow (materially again) that the minor
premise is true; and all thetis logical in the process is
the consequent decision that the major must be false,

and hence, by the principle of contradiction, that the κ

original question is true.

But one step only is wanting, to convert these material
consequentes into formal ones. We have in the συλλο-
γισμὸς ἐξ ὁμολογίας clearly the germ of the conditional
Syllogisms of Theophrastus. It needs but to commence
with the original hypothesis, not as a mere dialectis
convention, but as a proposition having its own inde-
pendent velue, and we have at cuce a distinct form of
argumentation, to which the Aristotelian specimen is
related merely as a prosyllogism supporting one of the
promises. This done, no great sagacity is required to
see that the prosyllogism may in this, as in any other
ease, bc omitted or not, according to the material
character of the premise which it supports.

To the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ ἀδύνατον may in like manner bo ’
traced the origin of the Disjnnctive Syllogism. The
most natural proceeding in this case is to state the two

‘For the principle oi contradiction may be assumed as seli-evident,
without any conventior) between disputante. And in this lies the principal
difference between tha deductio ad impossibile and the syllogism os agree·
