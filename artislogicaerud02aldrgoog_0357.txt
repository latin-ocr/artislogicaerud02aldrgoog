ΟΝ Tne cussrrrcarlort OF rotcherus„

Iu· has been before observed¹, that Aristode’s Treatise
περὶ σοφιστικῶν taimen has properly only a historioal
valne; that it is important as an account ol modes of
reasoning in use at the period to which it refers3 but
that it is not, and does not profess ιο be, a classifioation
based on any logical principle. Its divisione, however,
have boen followed without question by the majority
of subsequent logicians, centuries after the circumstances
which gave it its chief valae had ceasod to exist3 and
its language has become in a manner classical, though
not always restricted ιο the sense originally intended
by its author. Potitio Principii ond Iyoorots'o Eleoclti
still hold their place as recognised forms of fallacy;
and the continued use ol the Aristotelian nomenclatura,
at different times and under different circumstances, has
giren in some respecta a permanent velue to that which
originally was designed only for a temporary purpose.
It is not therefore intended in the present note ιο pro·
pose an entirely different classifioation and nomenclatura,
but only ιο point out certain principles, according ιο
which, if Logic is regarded as the Scienoe of the Laws
of Thought, an arrangement of Fallaoies may beat·
tempted on properly logical grounds, and some of the
deficiencies oi the received enumeration supplied.

The Aristotelian list is confined to Fallaoies connected
with Reasoning. But if Logic is the Soieuce, not of the
Laws os Reasoning only, but of those of Thought in gene·
ral, it willfollow that tho spurious formsof Conception and
Judgment are equally entitled to aplace among Logical

Fallaoies. And il all the processes ol Thought, so for
