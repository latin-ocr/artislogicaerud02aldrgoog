And even with respect to principles allowed tc he in-
ductive, the actual previous assumption of every possible
instance is not necessarily implied. And it is bere that
an able defendet of the Syllogism, Mr. Mill, has taken a
low and inadequate ground, a ground too, inconsistent
with his own subsequent enalysis of the process oi
Induction. His defence in fact amounts to an abandon-
ing of all formal reasoning. All reasoning, he tells us,
is really from particulare to particulare. But in thet
case, all inferenoe must depend upon the matter, and
cannot be reduced to any general type. If, for example,
l conclude that a man now living is mortel, solely from
the premises, “ Α, Β, and O, who are dead, were mortal,
end this man resembles them in certain other attributes
of humanity ;'' I may, hyan argument of precisely the
same form, prove any given man to be six feet high,
because A, B, and Ο, whom he resembles in the common
attributes of humanity, were all of that stature.

This portion of the question resolves itself into the
following. What do we mean when we essert that all
men are mortali Is it merely a concise mode os stating
that Socrates and Plato possess this attribute, in common
with a number of other individuale, quor uuae perscribere
usqum eet? lf so, to argue, “ Socrates is one of the
individuale above mentioned, therefore be is mortel,”
is, if not a beypiup of the question, at leuata needless
repetition of a previous statement.

Ι But, in fact, the Universal Propositiou means no such
thing. It means that, by virtue of a certain established
lew, certain attributes, or groups of attributes, are always
so united, that in whatever individuale we find the oue,
we may look upon them as au infallihle merlr of the
other. A conviction of this lrind however, as it een
never be gained by any mero observation ol particulare,
