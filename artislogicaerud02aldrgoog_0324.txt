To state that this hypothesis is ina oertain instanoe
true, adds nothing to the logical part of the reasoning‚
but only verifies the empirienl preliminaries whioh the
Logioian in every ease assumes as given. To exhibit
aformal oonsequenoe hypothetioslly‚ is only a needless
reassertion of the existenoe of data whioh the aot
of thought presupposes. To exhibit a material oon·
sequenee hypothetioally‚ is not to make it formal, but
only to state that, in a certain given instance, a eon-
sequenee not eognisable by Logio takes plane. 'I'he
sequence of “G is D‚'’ from “A is B,'’ is not one whit
more logical than it was before; it is only stated to taire
plaoe materially in the present ease.

The omission of hypothetioal syllogisms has fre·
quently been blamed as a defeat in Aristotle's Organon;
and his Frenoh translator takes some fruitless pains
to strain his text, in order to make out that he does
in faot treat of them¹. If there is any truth in the

preoeding observatione, it will follow, that Aristotle
understood the limits of Logia better than his oritios;
and that his translator had better hare allowed the
omission as a merit than have attempted to deny it as

a fault. When the hypothetica] proposition states a
formal oonsequenoe, the reasoning grounded upon it
may always be reduoed to eategorioal. When it states
a material consequence, it states what the Logioian, as
suoh, oannot take into aoeount Aristotle is therefore
quite right in saying, that in this ease the oonolusion
is not proved, but eoncededm. Syllogism may be em·
ployed as a logical proof of the anteoedent: the eon-
sequent is admitted to follow on grounds whieh the
Logioian, as anah, does not investigate, but whioh may
