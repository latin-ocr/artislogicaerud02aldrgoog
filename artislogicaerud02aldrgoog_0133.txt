(ἀναγκαῖον-ὀδύναων-ἐνδεχόρενον-δννωύν.) These he afterwards,
Anal. Pr. i. 2. l. reduces to two, the necessary aud tbe con·
tingant. See St. Hilaire's Translation, Preiace, p. aa. That
he adds the trae end the salae is questionable; the words
ρ’ληθές, οὐκ ἀληθές, 111 de Int. 12. 10. are perhaps only intended
to merk the previous tour pairs as contradictorios, 01 which
tbe one must be true, the other false. Subsequent Logicians,
following the Greek Commentators, have multiplied tbe
number 01 modes ed infinitam. Any adverb annexed to the
predicate, “homo 0111111 „aneae” or even an adjective qualifying
the subject, “homo albae currit,'¹ was regarded as forming a
model. The aerae τρόπος, as applied both to the modes 01
propositione and to those 01 syllogisms, is not Aristotelian,
but comes from the Greek Commentators. (Ammonius, Sebol.
p. 1301. 16.)

The postAristotelian modes effect the subject or tbe
predicate alone, not the relation between them. They ere
thus only pure propositione with complex terme, es is re
marked by Melanchthon, Erotentoto Dialecticep. 1311011. 1168.
Aristotle's modes effect the copule and the manner 01
thinking, and are psychologically distinct forma 01 the pro·
positiones they are rightly treated by Kant, Krttitc der r. V.
p. 71. But in alogical point 01 wiew, the distinction 01
modale is unimportant, aa not influencing eny further process
01 pure thinking. For tbis reason they are eut 01 place in the
logical writings 01 Kent and his followera. See further,
