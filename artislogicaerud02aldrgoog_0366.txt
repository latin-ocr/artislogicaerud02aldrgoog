species, or a combinaticn of all conceivable compatible
attributes, is essentially indistinct; for the number of
such attributes is indefinite, and, to go through them
in thought, enumerating and distinguishing one from
another, would require an infinite grasp of mind, and tn
infinite length ol dms, for its accomplishment.

Another class of notions may be specified as materially
inconceivahle; those, namely, which, though presenting
no logical contradiction, contsin attributes materially

· heterogenedus, and thus incompatible with each other.

Such combinatione of attributes as circulor virtue, or
coloured tlsoupltt, are of this character. “Black spirits
and white, red spirits and grey,'’ are only con·
oeivuble by investing the spirits with a body for the
occasion, and not by connecting the idea ol colour with
that of spirituality. Το the same class belong all com·
binations oi attributes inconsistent with tlte u priori
conditione ol intuition3 such ss a billaearfipurs ,· which,
though not logically contradictum, are mathematieally
inconoeivable. These must be earefully distinguished
fronr those notione which, though empirically known to
be careal, are yetperfectly consistentes thoughts; such as
the conception of a centaur, or oi a golden mountain. In

respect of these last, Logic recognises no distinction

between the real and the unreal. An opposite class of ’

notione materially inconceivable, are those which are
defective, as separating attributes whose union is testified
by experience to be indispensable to conception. Thus,
inasmuch as we know by experience, that no surfece can
be conceived, without being os some colour, and that no
oolour ean be conceived, exceptori some suriaco, the
conceptione ol an unooloured suriaco or an unextended
colour, though they present no logical contradiction,

tasting, lsws of thought3 and thus, as iar ss Logic is cosmed, they
belongto the matter ol thought, not to the lonn.
