founded ou an erroneous interpretation of Aristotle,
according to which that Philosopher is supposed to

condition is clearly laid down as a law of Demonstration3
and there is more than one with which it would be no
easy task to reconcile it.

positione which so many eminent Logicians have
regarded es legitimate deductione from the text of
‘ Aristotle3 it must be rernembered that we heve other
data sor interpretation besides the mere weight of autho-
rity. Aristptle’s theory of demonstration is priucipally
framed with reference to Geometry: the Scholastio

physical fictions connected with it, and to give a seeming

validity to the most potent demonstration of Risibility as
an emanation from Rationality; though that emanation
