nulli·, Species infima, quae omni cognato Generi

described, are both merely imaginary limite, never arrived at
in any process oi actual thought. 'l'he notion of Being or
even ol socam in general, apert nom this or thet special
combination oi attributes, and that ot a combination so
complex as to admit ol no additional attributes in thought,
are both psyebologioally inconoeivable. Α Highest Genus
and a Lowest Species may be admitted in any material
scienoe, as the limite at which the investigatione of that
scienoe begin and end; hut such a limitation ismsde entirely
on material grounds, relatively to the purpose of that par·
ticular science, and cannot be recognieed by Logic. See
Appendix, note A.

⁸ 'l'he Aristotelian Logicians consider the summa penno as
teu in number, via the ten categories or Predioaments ol
bristolie- These are abta, mdo, ποιόν, πρός τι, sot, ποκ’, κεῖσθαι,
ἴχω, ποιεῖν, :dogm usually hanelated, Substauce, Quality,
Quality, Relation, Plane, Time, situation, Possession, Action,
Pession. The Oategories heve by differem commentatore
been regarded as a elassification of names, ol things, and ol
both; aud have been alternately banisbed to Metaphysics
and recalled to Logic. Whatever position they may hold in
the Metaphyeical vvritings oi Aristotle, in his Logical ones
they are expressly declared to be a division ol' the notione
signified by simple terme. Em (τὸ ὃν) was not regarded as a
mmmm penus to the several Cetegories, being considered by
Aristotle end his followers as predicable ol them, not uni·
mosny, but eqtdwoaltp, or rather uuoloymoly. But a classib-
cation of categories is ont of place in Formal Logic. From
the analysis of any notion, whether given in itselt' or ae lorm-
iug part of ajudgment, I can by mere thinking arrive at the
simplest elementa it contains3 but I cannot by mere think·
ing determine that all notione so analysed will lead me to
exactly ten such elemento, neither more nor lese. This
requires aknowledge, not merely oi all the forms of thought,
but also os all the characteristics ol the objects about which

n think. On the principle ol the Aristotelian caa-
