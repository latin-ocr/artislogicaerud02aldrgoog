tho latter; but, when both interpretatione require some
attaining of Aristotle'a language‚ it is due to tho memory
of the Fathor of Logic to give him the benefit of diat
which does not conciet him of flagrem error in the
application of his own principles.

Referring baclr to the Syllogism above gisem tho major
promise may fairly be regarded aa par ro,- the subject
forming part of tho definition of the predicate. For
Equality, in the limited sense io which it is employed
in Geometry‚ is a property of Magnitudes 3 and the
latter, as the first and proper subject, will appear in
the definition of Geometrical Equality. This definition
hasbeen found by some Geometers in the eighth axiom
of Euclid; “Magnitudea which coincide are 'equali’
which, stated in tho Aristotelian form, would be,
“ Equality is tho coincidence of Magnitudes”.”

The minor promise may also be considered as par sa.
For our defiuition of a right anglo is, that it is half the
suro of tha two adjacent angles formed by onc straight
line with another; and our notion of two right angles is
that of the sum of the same two adjacent angles. Aa
regards the conclusion, wc need not trouble ourselves
with reduoing it to the requisito conditione, inasrnuoh aa
it is expressly said by Aristotle to comply with them.
This compliance does not directly appear in the only

form in which the proposition can be syllogistically

· prorod3 but in the oquipollent statement, that the

triangle is a figure of which the interior angles are equal
to two right angles. The predicate in this oasa states a
property of the trianglc, in the definition of which

property, if any be attempted, the proper subject must
he included.

A demonstrationes this kind certainly falls short, in
some respecta, of the scholastio model. Tha predicate
