or Rhetorical reasoninga are founded on τόποις the
others cn the peculiar principles of that Sciencc or Art
ιο which they belong¹.

Thia passage ia generally found puzaling ιο a beginner
on two accounts. Firatly, he ia apt ιο fancy Dialectie
synonymous with Legio, end ιο eonfound it with the
formal Soienee cs that name3 an error which the Gom-
mentary most likely ιο fall in hia way ia not unlikely

come inconsistenoy in the subsequent observation‚ that
acme Enthymemea are Rhetorical, othere not ao.

ln explanation it may be observed: First, that

material Arta. Their Logie ia not a onico όοοσοο,
treating ol the general form oi Reaaoning‚ but a Loya'ca
utana, treating cf Reasoning aa applied to a particular,
matter. That matter is furnished by the τόποι. Rhetorio
aud Dialectic do not merely lay down the form in which
their reeaoniugs ought ιο praeced, butlilrewise provide
certain general principles cf probability, from which the
matter of their major premiaes ia ιο ba drawn. These
τόποι or common-places hold the aame position in the
Dialectic Syllogism‚ aa the most universal kind of
axioma in the Demonstrative. They ara not gained by
exclusivo observation of any one particular elaea of
objecta belonging ιο this or that art or faculty, but are
indifferently applicable ιο all. Such is the example
qttoted by Aristotle aa ὅ τοῦ μᾶλλον nal ἧττον τόπος. Of
this in the Topica he givea four casea, oi which the
following may be taken aa a specimen. “Is themora
likely asserticu on auy subject be untrue, the loaa likely
