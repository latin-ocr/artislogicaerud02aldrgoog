vvith e sphericel triaugle, “ having three sides” is common
tc both ; the distinotion being, that the sides in theone
cese are straight lines, in the other, arcs of great cirotesn.
But vvhen one only of the compared notione is employed
es the subject oi a proposition, and e portion of the
attributes vvhicb it comprehendo is predicated of it, thet
predicate cannot properly be called Genus cr Differentia',
the comperison from vvhich these distinctions arise having
oeesed. ⁸

With this proviso, vre may adopt, mutatis mutandis,
the classificsticn of the Predicsbles given by Aristctle
himself, as furnishing a more satisfactory groundwcrlr
than either the Isagoge of Porphyry or its subsequent
scholastic embellishments. Every Propositicn‚ accord-
ing to Aristotle, expresses one ol four relations of the
Predicate to its Subject5 Genus, (under which mey be
included Differentia) Definition, Property, or Accident0.
For every Predicate must either be convertible with its
Subject cr not. Is convertible, it either expresses the
whole Essenos (τὸ ri ἦν olvat) of the Suhject or not. Iu
the former case it is called Definition, in the letter,
Property. linet convertible, it either expresses part of
the Essence or not. In the former cese it is Genus, in
the latter, Accident.

This division, being founded on dichotcmy by contre·
diction, must necessarily exhaust every possible mode of
Predicetiou. Interpreting the Essenee, in ecccrdence
with cur present view, as tha sum of the attributes

license oi interpretation may be allowed, vhen the object is to reconcils
