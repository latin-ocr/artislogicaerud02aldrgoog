&coenon have been used in various applications; retaining
however in all the primsry signification οἰ withdrawinp the
attention from one portion os certain phenomena given in
combination to fix iton the rest. In this sense Geometrical
Magnitudes aro called by Aristotle τὰ ἐξ ἀφαιρέσεως, (Aa. Post.
1. 18. l.); because the Geometer considers only the properties
ol the figure, separating them from those ol the material in
which it is found. (See An. Post. 1. h. 6. Metoph. x. 3. 7.)
On similar grounds is formed the scholastic distinction of
obstruet ond cosmeta terms; since in the former the attribute
is considered apert from the subject in which it is perceired

which they differ. For this resson Loclre calls all universale
obstruet ideas: a phrase etymologically allowable, but liable to
be eonfounded with the scholastic use of the word ohrtroct iu

term universale: which hus at the sarno time the advantage ol
leaving the Logician, as such‚uncommittedtoanymetaphysical

Universal Sabatenem, the Nominalist Universal Names, the
Conceptualist, Universal Notiorn.

which are at first signs of individual objects, and subsequently

ralization; but these are not processes ol thought, but ol per·
sephon, internal or external. Thus, to fix the eye or ear ou
a particular sight or sound exclusively, is in the widest sense
