sessurus. 179

The omission, therefore, iu the Aristotelian list, of
separate heads of olassifioatiou for mental states, oannot
be charged as a defeot in this point ol view, so long as
mind and its various states (whatever may be their dif· ι
serenae in other respeots) are represented hythe same
verba] forms es substsnoes and attributes. And aooord·
ingly we find various mental stateS, laouldes, passione,
habite, and dispositione, olassified together with eorre-
spondingoaffeotious of body, under the head of qualitiesl.
A more valid objeetion in a grammatioal point ol view
would be, that qualities in.their abstraot form are ex-
pressed by nouus substantive, and should therefore be
olessed under the oategory of substance. This objeotion
would be teneble iu relation to the distinetione of modern
Grammsr. But Aristotle appears to have limited the
substantive word to terme expressive of the αςὸπαι οὐσίαι,
or individual substanoes, and the δεύτεραι οὐσίαι, or their
several genera and speeies. The latter denote properly
the oategory of substerne, or substsnoe oonsidered as
one of the possible predioates of a proposition. Words
denoting individual substsnoes being subjeots only in
the proposition, do not properly indicate a ostegory1.

In referenoe, therefore, to the treatise of tbe same
name, we might fairly deseribe the Aristotelian (lategories
as au enumeration of the different grammatioal forms ol
the possible predioates ofs proposition, viewed in relation
to the first substante as a subject. And thir view is not
materially departed from in the other writings of Aristotle.
The passage quoted from the Topios, indeed, only oon·
tinues the same view, stating that those predicates, whioh
in their aetual relation to their subjecte in a proposition
