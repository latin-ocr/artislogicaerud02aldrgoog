transeut. ‘227

Exempla differs from Induction iu two prinoipal
points. l. Inductiou enumeratas all the individuale
in the minor term, so as to constitute the middle: Ex-
ample selecta single iristances. 2. Induction stopa at
the universal conclusion: Example proceeds tc inser
syllogistically a conclusion concerniug another indi·
viduali.

The Exemplo, as thus exhibited‚ has nc lopical value
asan independent reasoning. We are not warranted in
assuming, as a necessary law of thought, that two things
which resemble each other in aoy one picea quality must
lilrewise resemble each other in arry otha& The reason-
ing may have more or less material weight, according
to the character of the particular qualities compared,
and to what wc may empirically know ol their connection
with each other. It thus comes under the kind of
evidence mentioned hy Bishop Butler‘¹ as probolam
which admits of degreeS, and ol all variety of thern,
t'rcrn the highest moral certainty tc the very lowest
presumption. But degrees of evidence are inadmissihle
in Pure Logia. Either the conclusion necessarily
follows from the admitted truth of the premises, or it
does not. In the former case, all reasonings are in a
logical point cf view equally necessary3 in the latter, all

are equally worthless·. That the inscrence in Exam le
is material, not formal, appears the instant we at*

tc state it in symbolioal form: e. g. A and B are

X, A is also Y, therefore B is Y. This reasoning has no
force until we lrnow the matter, i. e. what particular
objects are signified by A and B, X and Ys.
