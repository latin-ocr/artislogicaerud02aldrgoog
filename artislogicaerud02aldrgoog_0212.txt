Method in either sense is not properly a part ol Pure or
Formal Logic. lt is an application os Logio ιο the discovery
or communication os truths in material science: its rules
cannot be determined ὰ priori from the laws of thought: but
must be gothercd empirically from the examination of perti·
culsr soiences, and will require modification in mony instances
from the particular matter with which they have ιο deal.

² The Metbodas inventionis can only be aproeess of inlerence:
sor no owanperaent os parts is possible before they heve been
discovered. The discovery of general principles from individual
objects of sense. il limited ιο the inferentiel process itself,
will be Induction. The term, however, is sometimes extendad
so es ιο include the preliminary accumulation ol individuale.
In this wider· sense it will embrace the four successive steps
given by Aristone, Anal. Post. ll. 19. αἴσθησις, μνήμη, ἆμπειρία,
επγογῃ.

Βοι the Methodici Inventionis must not be absolutely limited
ιο Induction ond its preliminaries, though these are the most
important instrumente of discovery. In some sciences, es in
mathematice, truths ara chiefly discovered by demonstratum
and, till so discovered, cannot, os course, be imparted ιο others
by the methodus doctrine.

Indue-tion and Syllogism ere the only two methods os

strenus, enumerate four, adding Division ‘ond Definition; but
in these last there is no reasoning process. See Zabnrella‚
de Methodis, lib. iii. cap. b sqq. If we extend the method of
discovery beyond tha process of inferenoe proper, so ss to
include any accumulation of knowledge, we may distinguish
three prinoipal instrumente. Ι. Pure experiencp, npplicsble to
