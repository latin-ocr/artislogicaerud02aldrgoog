eleventh. From the middle ef the eleventh ¹century
may be dated the rise ot' the Scholastie Philosophy
properly so called.

The body of Arabian Commentators darive their ap-
pellation from the langnage in which they wrote: their
’ places of residenee were rarione, and none of them
within the limits ef Arabia. In fact, the Arabiae lite·
reture did not arise till after the conquesta of the sue·
cessors of Mahomet had extended the Saraeen empire
far beyond the boundaries of their original country.
Like the later Greek Legiones, the Arabiens contributed
little original matter to the seience; their principal works
being either translations, made sometimes from the
Greek but more frequently from the earlier Syriae
versione, er abridgments and commentarios. Of these
the most importent are the logical abridgments ef
Avieenna and Algazel‚ and especially the voluminons
translations and commentaries of Arerroes A Latin
version of the translations ol Averroes, mede frome
Hebrew one, was the principal source from which the
earlier Sehoolmen derived their knowledge of all the
writings of Aristode, except his logical wmks, which
had been translated by Boethius. This herbernus ver-
sion continued in use even alter, a more accurate trans-
lation from the original Greek hed been made by
William ol Moerbeoke, under the direction of Thomas
Aquinas. The merits of Averroes es a commentator
heve been variously estimeted. Ludovicus Vives speaks
of him with great contempt. “Nomen est commentatoris
nactus, home qni in Aristotele enarrando nihil minus
explieat quam eum ipsum quem suscipit declarandum.’'
With this may be contrasted the enlogy ef Keekennann.
“Nemo tam veterum interpretum videri potest proximus
Aristotelis menti atque hic Arabs.” The modern critic
will probably take a middle course between the tno.
