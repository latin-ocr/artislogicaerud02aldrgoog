investigatas the unvarying laws ol* the heavenly phe·
nomena; but a practica] seicuce of Logia, to preserve
the mind from error, would be as absurd as an Astrouom'y
proposing to control and regulata the planete in their
courses. From· these consideratione it follows that,
even grauting Logia to be, under existing circumstances,
both a speculative and a practical selenae, yet tbe
former is an essential, the latter an accidental feature;
the one is necessarily interwoven with the elementa of
the system, the other is a contingent result of the
infirmities of those who possess it.

On the other hand, the Lopieu uteru may bc either
Science or Art, according to the purpose tu which it is
applied& Wheuever reasoniugs are employed on any
special objectos knowledge, there we have au instance
ol the chico atoue. The opposite view, which is some·
times taken on account of Aristctle’s dis‘tiuotiun between

the logical and the analyticcl or physical syllogism,
arises from a confusion between the Aristotelian and

the later sensas of the term logical.

It would bc both tedicus and unnecessary to discuss
in detail the various accounts that have been given of
the objectos Logic, by those who are agreed as to its
genus. Many of these may bc passed over, as being
merely verbal varieties ol the same fundamental view·.
One or two statements‚ however, require a brief notice,-

τ’· Distinctio peccat, quia auctores distinctionis vocant Logicam utau-
tem solum usum partis Topicre, enm Logiea utens vel conjuncta rebus ’
potissimum dicatur, et de aliis partibus Logicae rebus conjunctas numquid
uon poterunt applicari rebus oa qum de definitione et divisione demon-
strationeque praecepta traduntur? Ex quo sequitur ut Logica utens sit
quandoque vere Solantia, ut puta Physica vel hletcphysica, val siqua
clia est, physicus enim demonstraus mixtum ex elementis osse corruptibile
ost logicus utens, at talis Physica est Logica utens et vere Scieutia.''
Acerht Quart. Lug. Qu. IV.

ol Scotus with Archbishop Whately’s.
