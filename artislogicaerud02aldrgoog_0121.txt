substantes and at all times. Such properties ol the summum
genus are enumeratcd by Aristotle, Gateg. ch. b. These
were in the scholastic theory regarded as flowing from tbe
simple essence; those ol all subordinate classes from the
differentia.
¹² Porphyry, following Aristotle, does not distinguish Pro· ’

perty from Accident as flowing necessarily lrom the essonae,
but as coextensive and simply convertible with its subject. Ἴ
In thisbe is followed by Boethius: the other distinction, bow·
ever,appears as earlyasin the commentaryoihlbertua Magnus, r
end seems to have been derived from the Arabiane. (cf. Albert
de Predicab. Tract. vi. oap. 1.) The ἴδιον oi Porphyry mswers
to the fourth kind of property mentioned in the text. The
other three are occidam the first and third separable3 the
second inseparable, but still only an accident, as being pre
dicable oi more subjecta than homo. On the scholastic theory,
it is also an accident, aa not flowing necessarily from rationale,
the differentia. Aristode, who defines oran (poenitentium,
would regerd bipes es a differentia. It may be obserred that,
upon the principles of Aristotle and Porphyry, a generio χ
property can only be regarded aa a property with respect to
the highest species ol which it is predicable. Ae regards all
subordinate species, it must be considered as an occident.
Mobile, for example,a property os corpur, is an accident to
animo, and to Ιιοηιο, as not convertible with them. This may
be lairly inferred from Top. ii. 3, b. and is also maintained by
Avicenna and Albertus Magnus: see Albert de Predioab.

remain aproperty; but on this authorities are divided.
