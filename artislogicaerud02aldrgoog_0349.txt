Euclid's notiou, for he does not recoguiae the last
distinctiou3 both are with him simply propositions.
The expressod six postulates of Euolid arc not the

by those who will not assume without express statement,
that “two straight lines cannot iuclose a spacc.”

‘⁴ l. l. Thc following postulates are demanded: “if
two figures which have cue or more points in common
have each a point which is not in the other, the bound·
arias cf those figures must cut,” aud ‘⁶ every point is
without or within a circle, according aa its distance
from the centra is more or less thau the radius.'’ With
less, the intersection of the circlcs cannot be proved.
Ι. 4. This postulate ia assumed, “any figure may bc
removed from place to place without alteration of form,
and a plane ligure may bc turned round on the plane.”
But for this right to turn, 1. 4. would not prove 1. 52²

each. These then should bc classed among th'e aciemn,
or, as Mr. Dc Morgan more properly terma them, the
postulates. Definitions i, ii, iv, v, vii, viii, ix, are not
really employed as conceptione, but only serve to refer us
to the corresponding intuition; which in every case is

the basis of oue or more axioma, implied, if not expressly
stated. Among such axioma must bs classcd the follow-
ing assumptions. “Two lines can meet each other, aud
