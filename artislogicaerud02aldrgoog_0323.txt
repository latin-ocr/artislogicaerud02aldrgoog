the peculiar character of certain matters about which we
may think, and not a law of the form of thought in general.

Itis obvious that the relation oi promises aud oon·
clusion in a syllogism may, like any other relation of
condition and conditioned, be expressed in the form os
a hypothetical proposition: “ ll all Ais B, and all G is
A, then all G is B:” and the actual assertion of the
truth of these promises will furnich ct once aso-called
hypothetica] syllogism: “But all A is B, and all O is A,
therefore all G is BJ’ This was observed by Fries, who
hence rightly maintains that analyticel hypothetieal
judgments are formal syllogisme¹. Itis strange that,
after this, he should not heve gone a step further, end
discovered that synthetical hypothetice] judgments are
assertione of material consequences. The judgment,
“Il A is B,c is D,” asserte the existence of a conse·
quence necessitated by laws other then those of thought,
and consequentiy out of the province of Logia. The
addition of a minor promise and conclusion in the so·
called hypothetical syllogism, is merely the assertion
Ι that this general material consequence is verified in a
particular case.

The distinction so much insisted on by the Kantiane,
of the problecsoticcl characteres the two members of a
hypothetice] judgment, is, like the whole Kantian doc·
trine ol modality, of no consequence in formal Legio. ,
All formal thinking is, as regards the material character
of its ohjeots, problematioal only. Formal Conception
pronounoes that certain ohjeets of thought may possibly
exist, leaving their actual existence to be determined by
experience. Formal Judgment decides on the possible
coexistence of certain concepts; and Formel Reasoning,
on the truth oia conclusion, subject to the hypothesis of
tire truth of its promises.
