Α short aooount of these, as well ae of Plouoquet’s
system, is given in tho Appendix to Professor De
Morgon’s “ F ermol Logio‚'’ p. 8⁴23. ’

Kant bas done more lor logical sciense than any-Kana
philosopher sinos Aristotle3 partly in bis distinet
treetise on the subject, and still more in the exaet
examination of the forms and furrctions and limits of
thought wbioh runs through the Gritiqne of Pure Reason.
Το Kent is owing, what bas been so long needed, a
delinition ol Logia, whiob secures lor it a distinet and
positive field of inquiry, as the Seiam os tlte Necessary
Larua of Thoupht. Kant also did great servios in
banishing to a separate region, under the name of
Applied Logia, the psychologioal preoepts whioh his
predecessore, especially the (lartesions had inoorporated
with the body of the soienoe, and giving thereby to
formal thought its proper position as the object of Pure
Logia. His demonstration thot an universal material

more liberal and enlightened appreoiotion of the raol

At the same time, it must be admitted that the logical
system of Knnt is ohargeabla with ono serious deficienoy,
