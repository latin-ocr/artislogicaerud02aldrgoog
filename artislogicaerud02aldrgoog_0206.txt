thought cannot be actually separated from each other, being
merely tha same act ol thought viewed from opposite sides.
of objecta out ol the act οἰ thought, the thiakcr knows
nothing. But in comparing two minda together, one ol
whom is supposed to have afirm conviction of a true pro-
position on sufficient grounds, the other an equally firm con·
viction oi a false proposition, the difference between them
will lie, not in the state ol con'vlction which is common to
both, but in the objectori which it is exercised; and ths
change from error to knowledge will be affected by the
substitutiones one object for another. On the other hand,
il'a truth known scientifically by one man is asscuted to with
hesitation by another. the difference lies in their respective
states of mind in relation to acommon object, and the change
from opinion to knowledge will consist in a different mode ol
contemplating the same tr‘uth. Hence, in strict accuracy, we
should say, that the characteristic ol error is the attribution
ol certainty to a wrong object; that ol opinion, the absence
oi certainty in the subject. The criterion ol knowledge from
error is strictly the characteres the object as it appears tc a
rightly informed mind; and hence, among the later Logicians, ·
we find respectu objecti used as equivalsnt to per rc: and opposed
to respectu sabjecti, as it appears to this particular thinker. ’
This t'orras the connecting link between the scholastic use
ol oh'cctc'aa to denote what exista only in thought, and the
modern use, to denote tho absolute affectione ol things
without the mind.
