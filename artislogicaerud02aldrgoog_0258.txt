Μ8. Μ111. 18 these, the subjectis neither a word nor
8 8811881881 1188 several individual 118183881 which
a certain notion is predicable. For example, in the
Proposition, “All men are mortal,’' we do not mean
that the conception Μ88 includes Mortality‚ but that the
individuals possessing the attributes comprehended in
the former notion possess 8188 118888 comprehended in
the latter.

In distinguishing 8 certain portion 81 118888 Propo·
ritions as predicating Property, we must divest ourselvcs
altogether ol the noticn 81 necessary or contingent con·
cesion, and regard the word purely as a translation 81
1188 Aristotelian 1188. These Propositions assert, not
merely that certain objecta possess certain attributes, but

· that they alone possess them. This asserdon, however,

is very imperiectly expressed in the ordinary form 811188
affirmative proposition. The judgment, “ all equilateral
triangles are equiangular,’' does not by its mere 18888
imply that 811 equiangular triangles 888 equilataral. This
knowledge ir conreyed by the geometrical matter, not by
the logical 18888. To remedy this defect 81 18838838, 11

the propositione in which property is predicated 18888
118888 18 which accident is predicated, by attaching 88
universal sign to the predicate. “ 8111 equilateral triangles

The distinction adopted by Aldrich between Property

and Accidant, as necessarily or coatinpcwtby connected
with the subject, is untenable in formal Logic. If not
expressed in the copula, it implica the extralogical
knowledge 81 8 law 81 connexion existing or not between
the objecta signified by 1188 188888; 8 law which cannot
