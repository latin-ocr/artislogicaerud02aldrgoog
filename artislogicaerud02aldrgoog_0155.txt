alicujus tertii; idque propter Canones sequentes¹¹‚
in quibusvis omnis Syllogiatica firndatur.

l. Quae conveniunt in uno aliquo eodemque
tertio, ea conveniunt inter se.

hThese canons are an attempt ιο reduce all the three
figures oi syllogism direotly to a single principle; the dmum
. de omni et nullo ol Aristotle, which was universally adopted
by the scholastic Logicians, being direotly applicablc to the
first ligure only. This reduction, so long as the predicate
ot propositione has no expressed quantity, is illegitimate;
the terma not being equal, but contained one within another,
as is denoted bytho names major aud minor. Hence, as
applied to the first figure, the word conveniunt has to express,
at one and the same time, tho relation of a greater to a less,
aud ol a less to a greater-oi apredicate to a subject, andos
a subject ιο apredioate. In the system ο1 Sir W. Hamilton,
hy essigning a quantity ιο the predicate, the terma of every
proposition arc equal in extent; and the Ganons become
legitimate representatives ο1 the syllogism; but in this case
they are only narrower statements ol the true syllogistic lavs;
which are given in the Principles of Identity and Contra·
diction. (Every A is A; NoAis not A.) These, with the
Principio of Excluded Middle, (Every thing is either A or
not A,) are the highest and most exact statemeuts of the
Necessary Laws ol Thought. Ol. Proleyommc botre, p. 223.

Wallis mentions the (lanons as recent innovatione in Logio.
“Nonnulli autem Logioi, (nostri seculi aut superioris.) post·
habita veterum probatione per Dictum ds Omni ct de Nullo,
aliud substituunt illius loco Postulatum; nimirum, Quo con·
eonium in eodem tertio conveniant inter se. Imt. inq. l. iii. c. t.
ornamurve. Orq. l. ii. aph. 2⁷. Melanchthon (aromata,
p. 172, ed. 1568.) mentions them aa adopted by a sectos
Logicians in his day. The earliest writer in whom Ihavs
found them is Redolphus Agricola, De Iov. Dict. i. 2. He
describes at considerable length the offioc ol the middle term
aa a measure ο1 equality or inequality.
