mathematicsl necessity becomes identified with logical,
being only the result ot‘ the harmony ol a process of
thought with its original assumption. This consequence
is accepted by Stenart himself, as well as by Archbisbop
Whately, who speelrs of the denisi of geometrica] pro·
positione aa taff-coctrodr'ctory'.

This view may be refuted either directly or hy a
redactio cd absurdam for, firstly, it rests on an un-
tenahle assertion3 secondly, it leads to an inadmissible
consequence.

Firstly. It the properties of a figure follow from the
definition of that figure, it must either he because they
arc implied in tome cae attribute of that definition, or
because they are implied in tlte whole. Α triangle e. g.
will have its angles equal to two right angles, either
because it ie a rectilinear figure, or because it is of three
sides, or because it is both. The two first suppositione
are manifestly false: the third begs the question3 for
why tbe notion of a triangle, regarded as a complex
whole, has this property, is the very point at issue.

Hence it appears that the Definitions of Geometry, so
far as they are employed in demonstratioo‚ are merely
nominal. From the analysis of the complex notion no
conclusionis derived. The Definition only serves to
connect the notion as a whole with the name trioaplet

l This view ia also adopted by M. cousin in bis Lectores on Kant,
apparently as an exposition or the opinion ot llant himself, to which
however it ia diametrieally opposed.

⁰ This view is supported by the authority ol one equally eminent aa a
philosopher and a matbematician. Pascal (Penates, P. 1. Art. 11. rol. i.
p. 126. ed. Feugere) observes, ⁴⁴ On ne reconnatt en geomeme quales
