that which is incapable oi definition, and which in oon·
sequence necessarily involves its own failure. The same
may be said of the principal opinion which Aristotle
controverts. Whether we regsrd Pleasure‚ with Plato,
ae consisting in e motion towards a natural state of
harmony, or with Aristotle, in the perfect exereise of a
power; neither of these can be termed an explanation
of the feeling itsell, hut only of the ceuse by which itis
produced. Pleasure itself remeius an indefinite somo-
thing, consequent on the one or the other. Yet examined
according ιο Aristotle’s own view of the delinition ot
attributes, we see that pleasure is as fairly defined by
the perfection ol the exercise oi power, as an eclipse hy
the interception of light¹.

There ere, however, conditione end limite to the
definitione ol Attributes, though they are not the same
as those of Substances. Every Substance ιο be delineble
must be sSpeciee. Every Attribute must be aProperty,
i. e. must be capable ol demonstration by ite cause.
decidente then, as merely contingent attributes, are
incapable os definition. This limitation, however, is
merely relative to the degree oi our knowledge of the
matter. Tha edvanee of Soience may transform Acci·
dente into Properties, and thus furnish the requisito
means of definition.

Before concluding the subject, it will be necessary ιο
say a few words on two other points connected with
Aristotle's doctrine ol Definition.

‘Leibnita adopts the same view as Aristode, observing that pleasnre
admits ol ι musal, though not ot e moenai definition. Nouum Enete.

logical analysia; ris. when they are considered, not aa phenomene presented
to the sense, to be reselvsd into simplet sensihle phenomens, but aa oon·
tepts,or general notione, representative ol objects otthonghttobe recolved
into simplet concepte. On this distinction 1 heve remarked elsewhere.
