definiri possunt ad hunc modum. Quicquid in
multis reperiri potest, vel est tota eorum essentia,
vel ejus pars, vel cum essentia conjunctum'.
Quare Universalia vel (quod eodem redit) Prae-
dicabilia sunt quinque, et non plura; videlicet,
Genua, Species, Differentia Proprium, Accidens.

Aristotelian Logic, taken from tha Isagoge or Introduction
to the categorias by Porphyry, written in the third century.
Aristotle's doctrine, as lar as it cen h'e gathered from the
Topica, differs lronr that ol Porphyry in several points; as
does the latter from the view adopted by Aldrich.

¹ Quicquid iu multis, tte. These definitione are taken from
Albertus Magnus, (de Praedicab. Traot. H. cap. 1.) aad vvere
generally adopted by the Roaliets, in the form ol introduction
to, or commentary on, the Definitions given by Porphyry.
The Nominelists, on the other hand, expresaly denied that
any prediceble nas ol the essenos ol the individual. See
Ocearn, Logica, p. i. cap. 20, 21. To discuss the full bear-
ings ol this controversy would exceed the limite of a note.
It still be sufficient to observa, that a considerable portion ol
the languags adopted by Aldrich is not even intelligibls¹
except on realistic principles; and that whensrer the same

language is adopted by aNominaliat, he is ineuubly involved '

in inconsistenoiss and seli-contradictione. The same is in
sorno degree true of the original exposition ol Porphyry,
though the latter professes to leave the question ol Nomi·

nalism and Realisru open. But the question ol the existence
ol universals a parte rei is metaphysica, not logical, end
uo theory ou this point ought to influence the language of
Logia. The rules ol Logia are primarily regulative ol
thoughts ; and equally so, whatever opinion we may hold
concerning the essenoe ol things. For this reason, itis
necessary to alter nearly the whole ol Aldrich's lunguage.
iu speaking of the logical predicables. On the realist point
ol new, sea further, Appendix, note A.
