instance giren abore, may we not call the leot that“ this

statement a lilteliltood? Does not the whole distinction
depend on the question, which is the stated, which the
suppreeeed, promise l

To this it may be replied, that Aristotle distinguishes
the εἰκὸς end σημιῐον merely es propositione, and no where

says thet they may notbe combined in the sameusyllogism.
ln tbe instance giren, it ro hoppen-s thet the minor premise
is a singular proposition, end may fairly be considered a
ripn ol the conclusion. But we might obviously employ
a minor premise of another kind, such as, “All malig-
nant men are entious;'’ in which case there is, properly
speaking, uo rign employed in the reasoning. But this
does not effect the distinction between tbe two Pro-
poeilt'onr. A lilrelihood is erich, per ευρ-ο, proposition
stating e general truth, which we ere at liberty to apply
or not to perticuler cases. Α sign is e sign ol something
elee,-a single leot stated es a procl ol something further;
which procl mey, according to material circumstances, be
logically ot only morellg conclusive.

Another question sometimes raised is, “Il the En-
thymeme has both premisse supplied, how is it to be
distinguished from the Dialectio Syllogism ?” To which
it moy be answered, thet, taking the word Syllogism in
its striotest sense, as e reasoning logically correct, the
same argument may iu different points ol view be con-
sidered either as a Syllogism or an Enthymeme. This
is, ol course, only the osse nith the τικμῆςιονς the other
specimens of the Enthymeme being logically invelid.
The argumentation ἐκ τεκμηρίου is in this sense both
an Entlrymeme and a Syllogism—au Euthymeme on
material grounds, inesmuch as its premise is e ripn
ol its conclusion ;-e Syllogism on lorrnal grounds,
inaemuoh es it complice with the conditione of logical
