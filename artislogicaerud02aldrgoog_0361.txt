of limitation by differenoe, because the thing repre·
sented must be lruown as an eotual objeot, eud not es
the universe of ell possible objeots, it follows that the
indefinite ideas corresponding to the terme Thiug‚ Ex·
isteooe‚ Being in generel‚ ere not conoeiveble, es having
nodistiuotiveehareeteristie. They maybe elements of the
oonoeiveble; thetis to say, they may beoome conceivable
when eombined with eud determined by other attributes;
but so long es they ere given es isoleted, end therefore
as uuoonditioned‚ they ere ineonoeireble. The logical
rule here violeted is the Law of ldentity, whieh requires
that every objeot should be oonoeieed ss itself, and es
distinguished from every thing else. Here the supposed
Gouoept contains too little. On the other hand, is the
given attributes ere inoompatible with eeeh other, the
rule violated is the Law of Contradietion‚ whioh requires
'that two ooutradietory attributes should not be united in
the seme objeet. Here the supposed Conoept eonteins

process, if we attempt to oonoeive en objeot of which

Here again, the supposed Gonoept ooutains too little.
But it is obvious that these three lsws oenuot all be
equally violated in a pretended aot os Judgmeut or oi
Reesoning. In Judgment, the oonoepts ere already given3
and nothing remeius to be done, but to oonneot dem

there is no roem for a defioienoy of attributes; whieb
would effect the ooneeivebility of the terme themselves,
not the possibility of their anion in e judgment. The
only logioal fellaoy possible must oonsist iu uniting
