tho proof may be given in oetegorioal syllogismo. ln
others, it is for more naturally exhibited in the hypo·
thetios] form. A hypothetieal promise is sometimes
the only materially allowable assumption in oases where
the given antecedent ,end consequent have both terms
distinet. E. g. A is B, therefore (l is D. We may supply,
lf A is B‚c is D; but to determine the truth of the
assumed proposition, whether it bo hypothetioel or
eategorieal, does not fall within the province of the
Logioien. It may be questioned, however, whether the
mere assumption of ahypothetical promise ean make a
material oonsequenoe formal. See below, Note l.
Among these material, and therefore extralogieal,
ConsequeneeS, are to be olessed those whioh Reid
adduoas as eases for whioh Logie does not provide;
e. g. “Alexander wes the son of Philip, therefore
Philip was the father of Alexander ;'‘ “A is greater
than B, therefore B is less then A.” ln both these it
is our material knowledge of the relations “father end
son‚’' “greater and less,” that enables us to make the
inferente. ·
Another of Reid’s examples is the following: “A ls
equal to B, and Β is equal to (l, therefore A is equal
1 to 0.‘’ This reasoning is elliptienl, and therefore, os it
stands, material; though, owing to the suppressed promise
being sslf-evident, its defioienoy is apt to be overlooked.
Steted in logioal form, the syllogism runs thus:

Things that are equal to the same are equal to esch other3
A end G ere equel to the same,
Therefore A end G are equal to each other⁸.¹

Another example of the· same lrind is that sometimes
oalled reasoning a fortiori. E. g. “A is greater than B,
