of Logic, Metaphysics, Psychology, and Educational Pra-
cepte is put forth as the Artos using Reoson well in our
inquiries after truth, and the communication of it to others.
Equally vagus in its conception and unsystematic in its

contenta is the fragment on Logic by Jeremy Bentham.
According to his delinitiou, Logio is “ the art which has
for its object or end in view, the giving, to the best
advantage, direction ιο the human mind, and thence to
the human frome, in its pursuit of any object or purpose
to the attainment of which itis capable of being applied.”
In the same spirit as Hobbes‚ he considers Logio from
the utilitarian point of view, as a means to the augment·
ation of happiness. But the treatise, except as regards
some severe ond by no means just criticisms of San-
derson, has little in common with the Aristotelian system.
A more just and philosophical view of Logio will be

' n. found in the works of another English writer, Dr. Kirwan,

whose “Logio‚ an Essay on the elementa, principles, and
different modes of Reasoning,” was published in 180⁷.
Dr. Kirwan deserves honourahle mention ss one who
has profited by,¹ without servilaly following, the teaohiug
of Loclre. While adopting much that is valuable in
the writings of Loclrc and his successore, particularly
Berlreley and Gondillac, he has ably defended the
Aristotelian Logic against the depreciating criticisms of
Locha and his followers. Hs has however talen too
narrow a view of the field of Legio, in confining it ιο the
single process of Argumentation, in which, os well as in
his definition of it as both a Sciencc and an Art, he has
been followed by Archbishop Wh'ately ; while, on the
other hand, his treatment of the argumentative process
contains much which from the formal point of view must
be condemned as extralogiosl.

. The most important worlr on Logic from the Sohool
of Leibnita is the Philosophia Rationalis of Wolf, first
