rs the notes to Aldrich’s account of Definition,1hare
endeavoured to explain his langnage in conformity with
the views most commonly found in Logical Treatises.
But as these views differ in many respecta from those of
Aristode, on which they are supposed to be founded, and
as a correct account of the doctrines of that Philosopher
will materially assist in the solution of more than one
of those vexato quaestiones which are most perplexing
to beginners in Lugio, I shall attempta somewhat fuller
exposition here.

ln the second Book of the Posterior AnalytioS, Aristotle
mentions three different forms of Definition, in the
following words: Ἔστιν ἄρα ὁρισμὸς εἷς μὲν λόγος τοῦ τί ἐστιν
ἀναπόδεικτος, εἷς δὲ συλλογισμὸς τοῦ τί ἔστι, melosa haedique ς
ἀποδείξεως, τρίτος δὲ τῆς τοῦ τί ἐστιν ἀποδείξεως συμπέρασμαῆ
This passage isa concise summary of the whole Aristo-
telian theory of Definition. Adopting itas our text, we
prooeed to comment as follows.

A necessary preliminary to the determining the Real
Definition of any object, (τί ἐστι) is to ascertain that such
object exists (fu ἔστι). Otherwise our Definition will
be merely a nominal onel. But we have two classes of
dafinable objecta, of which the existence is determined
in two different ways, producing¹ a corresponding variety
in the form of the Definition.
