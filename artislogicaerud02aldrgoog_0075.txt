having given to me the concepte P end Q, 1 ean pro·
ncunce “P is Q‚” or “P is not Q‚” without a similer
eppeal, this is semul judgirrg. Il', having given to me
the judgmants “W is Χ,” “Y is Z‚’' I cen elicit e eon·
clusion from them alone, this is formul reoroning. The
term experience is here used iu e wide sense, for all
accidental knowledge, all that is not part end parcel of
the thinking act itself.

One condition of sunuel conceiving is,·that the attri-
butes given must not contradict one another. There
is no contradiction between the notione oi e horse's
body and e man's head. A centaur therefore is as
conceivablc es e man or a horse, whether such a
creature existe in nature or not. But if we try to
conceive a suriaco both blech and white in the seme
portion, the attempt to individualize the attributes hy
applying them to an object shews at once their incom-
patibility. Such a combination of attributes is incepeble
ol representing any possible object. Hence we have a
lew of thought, or condition ol logical possibility3 namely,
that whatever is contradictory is inconceivable. This
is the well-known Principle of contradiction, the most
general expression of which is, “nothing cen he Α end
not A,” or “ no object cen be conceived under eontra·
dictory attributes.” ’

Another lew of thought may he derived from the fect
thet all thought is representative oi possible objects of
intuitione Hence, whatever limits our constitution im·
poses d priori on the presentations of intuitiou, the seme
limits hold good oi the representatione of thought. Now
intuition is possible only under the condition of limit-
etion by differences. An object οἱ intuitiou, as such,
pcssesses definite characteristics, by which it is marked
