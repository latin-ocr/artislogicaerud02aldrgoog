mits only a relative differentia. His definition of man
is ζῷον λογικὸν θνητόη rational· being the differentia of man
when compared with brutes; morial, when compared with
the gods«. But if either of these attributes be selected
es the differentia of rnan absolutely, vve must again have
recourse to Realism to justify the position. If species are
made by Nature, they may have been so framed that each
has a peculias oharacteristio shared hy no other. How
this can be proved to he the case is another question;
hut there is nod priori impossibility in the supposition.
But if the species is hut a conception fonned by the
mind, what is to hinder us from forming four complex
notioris cho, abd, cod, bod, of which no pertiso dif-

the first from the second, h the first from the third, and
o the first from the fourth?

With regard to tha doctrine of the Infima Species
being the whole erronee of the individuale of which it
is predicated, the oasa is still clearer ; ,inasmuch as this
language was exprossly maintained by the Realists, and
e'xpressly repudiated hythe Nominalists. Itis true that
it is previously to he found in Boethius3 but here his
authority is of little value; as he appears in the character
of an interpreter rather than of a critic, and does not

In one of his commentarios on Porphyry he uses the
language of Realism ; in the other, he is a professed

definite in favour of the latter hypothesis, it would only
shew that he admitted details into his system incon-
