come under one oi the four heeds ol Genus, Definition,
'Property, or decident, come as simple terma nuder one
ol the ten Cetegories. The Metapbysical view ol the
ι Cetegories is not materially different. ln that work,
Aristotle enumeratos the different senses in which the
terrn Beiop (τὸ ὃν) is used, iu order to determine in what
sense it is applied to tbe object oi metaphysioal in·
quiries¹. Beinp sometimes siguifies the accidental
connection of an attribute with a subject, or of tvvo
attributes with a common subject. Itis also used co-
extensively witlr the Cetegories in predication3 thus vve
may say, uiuiparos ὑγιαίνει, οι· ἅνθρωπος ipsulm iuria, dulgas

πος τέμνει, or ἄνθρωπος τέμνων ἐστίν, the verb εἶναι being

admissible ns a copula in any proposition, whatever may
be the category'oi its predicator. But substance is the
πρώτοις ὄν, the proper object ol metaphysics⁰. ln this
account, Aristotle does not appear to bave distinguished
between tbe verb substantive, as denoting real existence,
and the copula as denoting the coexistence ol nolious in
the mind; but, as in other places, the categorias are
enumerated, not as an exhaustive catalogue of existing
things, but as alist of different modes of predicating by the
copula. They thus originally belong to Grammer, rather
than to Logia or Metepbysics‚ though the treatment ol
latter philosophers, perhaps in some degree sanctioned
by Aristotle himself, bas brought them into closer oon-
nection with the latter sciences, and overlooked their
proper relation to the formeri.
