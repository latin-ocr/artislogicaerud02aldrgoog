³ Rei. i. e. of en universal notion existing in the mind; with·
out entering on the question whether there existe uny externel
universal nature corresponding to it Since cll such notione
are represented by words, ureol, or more correctly spenking
c notio-nol, definition, will nt the sume time unlold the meaning
of the word by which the given notionis represented. Still
the two kinds ol definition must not be coniounded. A reul
definition hus primurily for its object to nnulyse u complex
notion into ite component parts. Words ure employed
recondarily, though unevoidebly, us signs, both oi the whole
notion, und oi the simplet notions of which it is composcd.
But the objectos nominul definition is to determine ol whct
notiori, simple or complex, a given word is the sign. The
notion muy be nlreedy known, more or less clearly, by mouns
ol other signs, though we were not awure ot* its connexion
with the word in question. Α different distinction between
nominel end recl definition is given by Leibnitz, Nooceouc
Ennii, l. iii-c. 8.

Π this account oi reel definition is correct, it will follow
thet the sume notion ndmits os only one definition; since
the sume notion cannot be acombinution ol more theu one
group ol attributes. And nothing cen be more clesr then
Aristotle's testimony on these points, nothing more positive
then his repudietion oi the soculled occidental end ptyricol
definitione. (ct. Top. vi. 4, 2. vi. lt, t. i. 8. 2, 3. Meteph. vi.
