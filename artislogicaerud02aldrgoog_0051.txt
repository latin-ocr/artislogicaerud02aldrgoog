numen· On the other hand, the Aristotelian Logic, purified of
mon. many oi its scholastio accessions‚ was defended and
taught hy Melanchthon. The earlier editions of his
Erotemota Dialectica preceded the attacks of Ramus¹3
bnt in 154⁷ he published 0 new edition, in the intro-
duction to which he says, “Ego veram, incorruptam,
nativam Dialecticeu, qualem et ab Aristotele et aliquot
ejus non insulsis interpretibus, ut ab Alexandro Aphro-
disiensi et Boethio accepimus, prmdico. . . . Etsi multi
Aristotelicos libros vituperant, et tanquam tabulas dis·
persas fracta navis esse dicunt, tamen, si quid ego
judicare possum, affirmo eos Dialecticen recte tradere,
et ab iis, qui liberali doctrina exculti sunt, intelligi
posse.” Melanohthon however agrees with Remus in
considering Legio as 00 Art. “ Dialectica,” he says, “est
ars seu via recte, ordine, et perspicue docendi3 quod fit
recte definiendo, dividendo, argumenta vera connectendo,
et male cohaerentia seu falsa retexendo et refutando.'’
Under their united sanction, this became the prevailing
doctrine of Logicians. The authority of Melanchtbon
established the Aristotelian Legio in the Protestant
schools oi Germany and Helland‚ and in Britain. At a
later period, 0 conciliation was attempted between this
Inar⁴ system and that of Remus. Burgcrsdyolr, in 1626,
