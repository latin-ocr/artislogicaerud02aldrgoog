eud superscription on two coine moy present no dis-
cemibIe marks of distinction from euch other 3 but if on
that account we sey that they are the eume, we employ
the vvord in en equivocsl sense, which must be cerefully
distinguished from that in'vvhieh we say thet both sre
struck from tlte same die. In the letter sense, the
attributes forming the humenity of Socrates cre not the
seme with tbose forming the humonity of Plet03 though
the common notion mon embraces both, end though, by
avsiling ourselvee of an ambiguity of lenguage, we say
thet both ere of tlte same species.

Genersl notione thus framed by the mind, when
expressed in languege, form common terme. And the
vsrious attributes eomprehendedk in every euch notion
are its logical essence¹. By this we do not moun any
thing necessary to the physicei existence of sn object3
but merely that, se genernl notione are formed from
the observetion of similer attributes in individuale, every

individual must possess such attributes, if it is to be
included under the extensiou of the noticn and called

⁴ In a Pumphlct published under the neme of “A Dieeertotion on the
Heads ot* Prediceblee‚” I inadverteutly adopted Mr. Mill's expressions or
mantulos and moleton, to distinguish between the cuributes contained
in a complex notion, und the subjecte of vhich it is prediceted. The
distinctionI still regsrd ss most importent, end one thetis not perhaps
sufficieutiymarired in modern luugnag03 but further etudy of the scholastic
phrsseclcgy hes led me to regmd Mr. Mill's languege ss too vides
departure from the original use of the terune. For this reason 1 have
preferred the expressions Comprehendere and Excusat, os better sanc-
tioned by Logicsl authority. Cf. Port Rcyal Lugio, P. Ι. chap. d. ¹⁸ J'eppelle
comprehensiva de l'idee, les attribute qn'slle enferme en soi. J'eppelle

Gonnotaticu‚ see p. lc, note g.
