coniounded with the inquiry, whether the hypothetioal pro-
position is fonnally the same with the categorieel. The latter
is answered by Kant in 'the negative, but that decision does
not affeot the present question. The seduction ol hypothetiesl
syllogisms must be govemed by the same mles es that oi
categorioals ; end in the letter ease, itis allowable to substitute
for a given proposition another which, though not identitatis
implied by it. For instance, a pmtieular proposition may be·
employed in the plaee of an universal. So in hypothetioals,
if the new propositione oontain the same terme, end are
immediately deducible from the original ones, the seduction
is legitimam. This will generally be the ease when the
hypothetioal proposition has but three terms; both clauses
having the same subject or the same predicate. The following
instantes may thus be reduced ·.-

All A is 0. AllA is Ο.

These syllogisms indeed, vvere admitted hythe Ramists,
the great advocates oi hypothetioals, to be eategorieel. But
where the hypothetioel has four terms, as, ‘⁴ Il A is B, C is
D,'' this mode of seduction is not praetieable; yet even in
this ease e categorieal syllogism may be oonshueted, whose
propositione, though expressed in different terme, are implied
in those of the original syllogism. Thus:
Constmotive. Destruotive.
