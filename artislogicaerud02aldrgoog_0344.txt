lV. The Synthetioel Axioms ere thus tire ground of ell

tious3 but the Analytiool Aeiome ere employed also, es
expressiug general oonoeptioos of equolity ond inequality

Stewort was led into his erroneous view of definitione by
bis contempt for the syllogism‚ wbiob he would not
sllow to be under ony oiroumstenoes the type of demon-
strative ressoning. In this oontempt Mr. Mill does not
purtioipete, end he bes oooordingly exhibited tho fifth
proposition of Euolid demonstreted in syllogistio form.
In this demonstretion we see both analytioal‘end syn·
thetiosl uxioms employed es major premises ; the former
es general formulae, founded on the oonoeption of

' equitium the letter es tbe means of epplying this

- general oouoeption to geometrioel maguitudes, in which
the test of equolity is coincidence. One or the other will
bo employed iu different syllogismo, eooording es the
major term tube proved is equolity or coincidence. Tho
minor promises ore furnished by the oonditions, given or
oonstruoted, of the porticulus figure.

Ageinst tho form of the geometrioel syllogism es
exhibited by Mr. Mill the logioien will heve no ob-
jeotious to ellege3 though the memphysioian will not be
disposed to sequiesoe in his statement thet tbe oxioms
of botb kinds ure gained by induction. And it is not
striotly eoourete to represent the first three exioms of
Euolid es ospeble of proof by en imaginory super·

equality in general, but only of equelity in superfiuis}
magnitudes. To the oxioms us employed in Geometry
