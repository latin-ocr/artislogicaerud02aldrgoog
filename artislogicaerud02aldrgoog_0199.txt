Certa eutem propositio est, cui nihil occurrit

¹ This definition is vegue enough: the example, however,
shows more clearly whst is intended. For multe wus
regarded ss s property, flowing immund demonstreble by,
the differentia rationale. We may therefore define s certain
proposition es “s proposition capable oi demonstration.”
It will thus be distinguished from un evidere proposition,
which is axiomatio und indemonstmble. Bou ere, oi course,

bulthe former is the conclusion ol' e demonstratum the

give oe exemplos, oi s certain proposition, “The engles oi

Such seems cleurly to be Aldrich's meaning in the present

this pert is chiefly taken.) Aldrich's subsequent lungusge,
however, is bynu means consistent
