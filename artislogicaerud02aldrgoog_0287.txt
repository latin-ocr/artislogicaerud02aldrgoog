end B is greater then 0, therefore a fortiori Α is greater
then C.” The logioel form is,

Whetever is greater then e greater then G is greater then 0 ;
Α ie greeter then e greater then G,
Thereiore A ie greeter then O.

Or it it he required thet the a fortiori neture of the
reesoning appear in the conclusion, ne must stete the
major, “ Whetever ie greeter then e greater then G is
greater then C hy agrenter differenoe.”

Oi the eeme kind is the reesoning “A is eqnel to B,
therefore twice A is equel to trrioe B.'’ The logionl
form ie,

The doubles of eqnnl things ere equnl;
Twioe A end twioe B ere doubles of equnl things,
Thereiore they ere equnl.

The major premiee might be steted more generally,
“ Equimultiplee of equnl things ere equnl.''
