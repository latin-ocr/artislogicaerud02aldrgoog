‘⁸ The error,” continues Sir W. Hamilton, “would be
of comparatively little consequence, did it not induce
a perfunctory consideration ol the laws ol those iaculties
of thought3 these being viewed as only subsidiary ιο
the process ol' reasoning.” Of the trnth oi this charge
there can be no question. A student might read
through nearly every nuc of the popular trectises on
Legio, without finding the sligbtest hint οι the fact, that
in the processes of conception and judgment, as well as
in that οι reasoning, there is a distinction tc he made
between the form of the thought and the matter, the
former being equally in all three processes accurately
and completely determinable by logical rules3 the latter
being equally in all three beyond the domain nithe
sciense. A thought may violate its own lawe, aud thus ι
virtually destroy itsell ; cr it may be perfectly consistent
with isselt, but at varianae with the facts oi experiente.
Τὴο result in the one case is a produnt logically ille·

ln both cases alike the mind is supposed ιο be
already in possession of the necessary data for thinking
at all. Where there is a material deficiency in the
conditions preliminary ιο an act of thought, we cannot
be said to think logically or illogically; for we cannot
attempt tn think at all. Thac, if we are told tc conceive
objecta which have never been presented in their
proper experientes colour for instance which we hare
never seen, or a scant which we have never smelt; or
it we are required ιο form a judgment, other than iden·

less than· two premises, we are in the position oi a
builder without materiale, who can neither obey nor
