Pletonic dialogues‚ as well as in the Memorabilia of
Xenophcn¹. F or this purpose, be insiste on the superior
fitness ol his own brief discourses to the longer mode ol
reasoning employed by some of the Sophiste, end says
that many oratore ean discourse ably at length, but that, ’

dialectis form may have contributed more or less to that
systematized method of disputation exhibited in the
tuo last trectises of the Organon. The antecedente of
Aristotle¹s more strictly logical labours appear in other
and more subordinate points of the philosophy of his
predecessore. We may pass over, es unquestionably
