Logicieus of eminence, who are agreed es to the genus
of Lugio, are et issue es to its species. Granted that
Logic is a science‚ is it speculative or practical? Wolf,
the ablest of the German writers on Logic before Kent,
wbile distinguishing accurately between Science and
Art, regards Logic as belonging to the practical, not to
the speculative anienem, the knowledge which it fura
nishes being subservierit to the discipline of the mind
und the acquisition of further truths. Accordingly
be defines Logic as “ Sciantia dirigendi facultatem cog-
noscitiram in cognoscenda veritatc⁰.” On the other
hand, Kant, who defines Logic as “the Science of the
necessary lawe of the Understauding aud the Reason,”
considers and treats it as speculativct, and the same
view is well maintained by the excellent Frcnch trans·
lator of the Orgenou, M. St. Hilaire‚ whose language
may be quoted as an accurate and admirably expressed
· statement of the true purpose of Legio and the spirit in
which it should be studied. “ Sans la logique, l’esprit
de l‘homme peut admirablement agir, admirablemeut
raisouuer; mais sans elle, il ne se connait pas tout
entier: il ignore l'une de ses parties les plus belles et
les plus secondes. La logique la lui fait connaitre.
Voilri son utilite: elle ne peut pas en avoir d‘autreu’
That this letter is the true view is manifest, es soon as
we distinguisb accurately between the essentia] con.-
tents of Logic and its occidental applicatione. The
benefits performed by Logic as a medicine cf the mind,
however highly we mey be disposed to rate thern, are
