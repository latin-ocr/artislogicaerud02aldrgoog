the facts to the law, accepting as genuine all that
actually occurs, and rejecting every law that does
not account for the facts. The two systema are thus,
opposed iu their methodi.

On account of these differeuces, the fundamental
conceptione of the two systema cannot be expressed
in the same terma without ambiguity. Low in the
Aristotelian system implies a consciousness of obli·
gation, which existe whether realised or not in practice.
Low in the Bacouian system means an uniform se·
quence, which existe only as it ia realised in practice.
ln the field of nature, the conceptione of roura and effect
imply no more than the antecedent and consequent phe-
nomenou. In the field of thought, the caure is the oon-
soiously productiva aelf, the ffers, the thoughts which
hy its own power aad under its own lans it produces.
Necessity in the one ease denotas what invomebly ir, iu
the other, what cannot tar te thouyht. ln short, there
is hardly a term in the one which cau be transferred to
the other, except by arralogy. ln all that ie phenomenal,
the facts of thephilosophy of matter can only be applied
by imperfect analogy to the philosophy of mind. In all
that is real, the facts of the philosophy of mind ean only
by imperfect analogy be made use of iu the philosophy
of matter. The Aristotelian Logic, 'like Mathematics
and Moral Philosophy, is constructed dpriori from con·
ceptions3 aud its principles and conclusions are pri-
marily true of the conceptione, secondarily only of actual
objecta, on the supposition that they conform to the
conceived model. The type of perfect reasoning is the
same, though there may not be such a thing as a perfect
reasoner in the world; just as the standard of morality
is the same, though no man is morally perfect, aud as
the demonstratione of Geometry hold good of conceived
figures, though such figures in their mathematicel exact-
