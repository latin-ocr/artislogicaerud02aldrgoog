position simply convertible. This is requisito, in order
to comply with the condition of quatenus iprum. ,

This Demonstration is exeeedingly satisfactory, if we
are only allowed to assume all the conditione oo which
its validity depende ; viz. l. that risibility does flow as
an effect from rationality as a cause ; 2. that the major
promise, in which this causation is asserted, is an
axiomatis principle, cognoscible a priori, and, as such,
carrying with its cognition, the conviction of necessity3
8. that the conclusion is not a mere repetition, in dif-
ferent words, of the major premise3 frome and aabnof
rationale being identioal; 4. that any Demonstration
aoknowledged to be valid ean be resolved into the above
form.

But waiving the consideration of these questions,
which are more easily celred than answeredl, we may
find a simplet way of testing the demonstratio potissimo,

by going baels to the original authority. For Aristotle’s
examples are principally tehen, as is natural, from the
Mathematios; and it is to a Geometrical theorem that the
texts of aar aet andyl αὐτό are expressly appliedt. (lan
it be believed, then, that Aristotle regarded the following
as a correct analysis of Geometrical Demonstration?

Every rectilinear figure of three sides hes its angles equal
to two right angles;

Every triangle is a rectilinear figure of three sides ; therefore

Every triangle has its angles equal to two right angles.
