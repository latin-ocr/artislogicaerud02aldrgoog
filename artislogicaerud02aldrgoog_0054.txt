traoting of our thoughts aod of their signs. A pro-

position is but the addition of two names, and a
syllogism the adding together of three. In aproposition,
tvvo names are so eoupled together, that he that speaks
eonoeives both to be names of the same thing3 from
whenoe it follows thet truth end falsehood oonsist only
in speeoh, and that the first truths were arbitrarily
made by those who first imposed names ou things. A
full eritioism of this doetrine would axoeed my present
limits. 1 ean only observo that the main error of Hobhes
does not lie, as is sometimes said, in his theory of notione,
but in that of judymants. He has overlooked the faot,
that apprehension is primarily the analysis of judg·
ment, not judgment the synthesis of apprehensione
'lhe Bononian influenoe is also manifest in Gessendi,Gassendt
the friend of Hobhes and the antagonist of Desoartes.
Like Hobbes, he deseribes reasoning as a eomputation,
and he entioipates Oondillao in traoing all knowledge
to sensation. He adopts the fourfold division of Logia,
into Apprehension, Jndgment, Reasooing‚ and· Method‚
vvhioh had virtually been invented by Remus and
aoeepted by the Semi-Ramists, and whioh was shortly
afterwards adopted hy the Port Royal Legio. He
admits two figures only of Syllogism, an affirmative
and a negative, (ansvering to the affirmative and nega·
tivo moods of the first figure in Aristotle3) end it is worthy
of remark, that in the order of the promises, he returns
to the arrangement of the Greek LogieianS, (the reverse
of that of the Latina) and planes the minor before the
major. His theory of reduotion, by whioh he brings
every syllogism ostensively ιο his two figures, oontains
some eurious blunders.
