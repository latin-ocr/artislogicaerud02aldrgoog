occidental only, and arise from⁰causes exterual ιο the
soience itself: its speculative character, aa an inquiry
into the laws of thought, is intercal and essential. To
the twofold character ol Legio, two conditione are neces·
sary. Firstly, that there should exist certain mental
laws ιο which every sound thinlrer is bound ιο conform.
Secondly‚ that it should be possible ιο transgress those
laws, or to think uosoundly. On the former of these
conditione depends the possibility of Logio aa a specu·
latire solenes: on the latter, its possibility as a practica]
soience. Now if we loolr at these two conditione with
reference ιο the actual contents ol pure Logic, it is
manifest that the abrogation of the first would utterly
annihilata the whole science3 whereas the abrogation
of the second would at most only necessitate the removal
of a few exoresoenees, leaving the main body of logical
doctrine substantially aa it is at present. suppose, for
‘exempla that the differente between sound and uosound
reasoning could be discerned in individual cases as a
matter of fact, but that we had no power of olaesifying the
several instances of each and referring them to common
principles. lt is clear that under such a supposition,
the present contenta of Legio, speculative aod practioal,
could have no existence. The number of sound and
uosound thinlrers in the world might romain muoh as
it is noiv3 but the impossibility of investigating th'e
principles of the one and applying them to the ocr-
reotion of the other, would malie a system of Legio
nnattainable. But let us imagine, on tho other hand,
a rece of intelligent beings, subject ιο the same laws of
thought asmanlriud, but incapable of transgressing them
in practice. The elements of existiug Legio, the Con-
cept, the Judgment, the Syllogism, would romain
unaltered. Logic, as a speculative science, would
investigate the laws of unerring reason, as Astronomy
