Some valuable hints on this point may be gethered
from a very able and interesting papcr by Professor De
Morgan, printed in the Componion to the Althaeae for
1849. 'Ibe following extracta indicate a principle which
might be pursued to further results. '

“Book Ι. Βςῇηὲίίοπε. Of these, iii, vi, xiii, are obvious

statements, but not definitione of words3 viii, xxvi, xxxi
to xxxiv, are never subsequently used; xviii, it semicircle
have its etymological meaning, as seems the intention,
is a theorem, which ought to bc iii. 1. The remaining
definitione are of two kinds: first, those which do not

explain their terms, but demand a notion already existing
in the ¹student's mind3 they are i, ii, ir, v, vii, ix: sccoudly,
purely verbal definitions3 they cre x, xi, xii, xiv to xvii,
xix to xxx, and xxxv. Insist on angle as a magnitude.-
on the comparison os angles cs to greater, eqncl, or less,
by superposition3 on the rights oi angles equal to and
greater thantwo right angles. The angle made bya ,
straightlinc with its own continuation is a definite
angular magnitude; aad its half is the best definition
of a right angle. lt is to be regretted that there is no
single phrase for “two right angles.”

‘⁶ Postulate and acione: In Euclid‚ postulates and
common notione. All Geometrical demands are postulates
in Euclid3 hie axioma or common notions are in every
instance notione commento all kinds os magnitude as
well as space magnitudes. Restare this: thetis, let
the postulates he, Sirnsou’s postulates, and axioma, x, xi,

coincidc in two points, they coincidc when produced‚'’
aa more seli-evident. From this it is seen that the
doubles of all right angles are equal‚ and thence that
all right angles arc equal; and this should come between
Ι. 12. and 1. 13. as a proof of the theorem, “all right
angles are equal.” F or xii. substitute “ two lines which
