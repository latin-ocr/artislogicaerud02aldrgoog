Syllogism is supposed ιο proceed either from the affirm·
ution of one member to the deniel of the rest, or from
the deniul of ull but one ιο the affirmetion of thet one,
by the Principio of Excludsd Middlel.

This cun scarcely be regarded cs s correct snelysis of
the process, unless tho two members ers sormclby stated
es contradictory. The Principle of Excluded Middle
esserts that every thing is either A or not A, thet-of two
contradictorios, one must exist in every subject3 as the
Principle of (lontrcdiction esserts that they cannot both
exist But ifthe two members cre not stated as contre-
dictories, if my disjunctive promise is, “All Ο is either A
or B,” I melre the materici essertion thet All G which is
not A is B. If then Ι resson, “This 0 is not A¹, there·
fore it is B,” I employ the Principle of ldcntity in uddi-
tion ιο that of Excluded Middle. Agsin, it Imuintein
thet No 0 can be both A end B,I melre the material
essertion that No 0 which is A is B; end from hence to
resson,“'1his G is A, therefore it is not B,” requires not
the Principle of Excluded Middle, but thot of Contru-
diction. In the first cese, the Excluded Middle does
not lecd directly ιο the conclusion, but only to the con-
traposition of the minor premise. When we deny this
C to be A, this principle encbles us to essert thet it is
not-A, and hence to bring the reasoning under the Prin·
ciple of ldcntity. But in the second osse, in which one
ol the opposed members is cffimted, the ground on which
we deny the other, is not beccuse both cannot he false,
bnt because both csnnot bc truc.

It moy bc questioned whether this second inferencs is
wcrrented by theform of tho disjunctive premise. Boe-
