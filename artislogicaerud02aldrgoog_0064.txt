“ Turn Logic‚” says Kaut, “ has even from the earliest
times advanced in the sure course 010 0010000,10 manifest
from the 1001 that since Aristotle ir 1100 taken no back-
ward step.‘’ “Itis worthy 01 remark however,” he cou-
110000,“11101111100 also up to this time been 01110 10
take no step forwerd, and thus to all appearance seems ·
to be concluded and perfeeted.” This remark 10 11110
00 regards what Aristotle did3 but on the other hand, 00
regards what Aristode 1011 00110110, itis 00 1000 1100 that
the whole subsequam history 01 the 0010000 exhibita
scarcely any thing but 1110 ebb and flow 01 0000111011
0010100. The master 1011 behind him a collection 01
writings3 and to the substance 01 that collection his
disciples have, 1011110 100010011, faithfully adhered3
but he 1011 00 definition 01 the soience 00 which he
wrote, and no principle for determining its boundaries;
and these accordingly 11010 been matteras controversy
ever since.

Clitomachus compared 1110 Logic 011110 day to the
moon, which never oeascs waning and waning0. The
cause 01 0001010101 has assurcdly not been diminished
by the labours 01 subsequent expositore down to the
present time. Few logicians 11010 10 their practica}
treatment materially added to or taken from the original
body 01 the system: lew on 1110 other hand are theora-
tically agreed as to what it is that they 010 expounding.
Ask 01 almost any writer, “What is Logic?” the reply
is almost unanimous, 11101 11 10 the subject treated 01 10
Α11010110’0 Organon. Ask what is this subject3 and
nearly every commentator has a different definition.
