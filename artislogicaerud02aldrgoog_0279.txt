The first ol these is his methodos investigating, or,
as he tenna it, hantinpsor, the Definitiou. '1his may he
effected in two ways, commonly called the methods of
Division and Induction. The first of these consiste in
taking a wide Genus, under which the object to be defined
is evidently included, and connecting it hy the addition
οἰ successive differentiae, till we obtain a complex notion
coextensive with that of which the Definition is sought.
Of the notion thus obtained, each separate part is more
extensive than that which is to be defined, though tlte
whole is not sofl. A good example of this method is·
given by Cicero: “Sic igitur veteres precipiunt: cum
sumseris ea, quae sint ei rei, quem definire velis, cum
aliis communie, usque ·eo persequi, dum proprium
efficiatur, quod nullam in aliam rem transferri possit.
Ut hoc, Hereditas est pecunia. Commune adhuc:
multa enim genera sunt pecunias. Adde quod sequitur:
quae morte alicujus ad quempiam pervenit. Nondum
est definitio: multis enim modis sine hereditate teneri
mortuorum pecunias possunt. Unum adde verbum, jure:
jam a communitate res disjuncta videbitur, ut sit ex-
plicata definitio sic: Hereditas est pecunia, quae morte
alicujus ad quempiam pervenit jure. Nondum est satis3
adde, nec ea aut legata testamento, aut possessione
retenta: confectum ,stru Δ

Ι Anal. Post. ii. 1³. 8. Τὰ δὴ τοιαῦτα ληπτέον μέχρι τούτου, der τοσαῦτα

ταύτην γὰρ ἀνάγκη οὐσίαν olvat τοῦ rpdypcrca. Yet in the Metaphysios
(vi. la.) he seems te maintain that the last differemia must be co·
extensive with the subject; a view generally adopted hythe Scholastic
logicians, though manitoetly inconsistent, not only with the passage above
quoted, bot with the example appended, rh ti τελευταῖον rol τῇ δυάδι. In
tha Metaphysics however he seems to he speaking, not ol tho specilla
differencs per ae, but ol the difference regarded as dividiug the genus.
But this is in lact equivalent only to saying that the whole must be oc·
extensive; which no oue would think ol denying.
