formed of the first subject and the last predicate. It may be
expanded into a series of syllogismo in the first figure, the
conclusion of each being the minor promise of‚tbe next

can only be one particular premise in a Sorites, tbs first: tbe
others being major promises in the first figure. And the last
is the only premise which may be negative: for any previous
negative premise would produce a negative conclusion, which
could not be used as a minor premise in the next syllogism.

The Sorites is not recognised as a distinct kind ol reason-
ing by Aristode. Nor is there any reason why it should have
been ; as it is merely a combination of ordinary syllogismo,
