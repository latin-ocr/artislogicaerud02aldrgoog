notion belonging ιο them, but are mere arbitrury marks

imposed for the purpose of distinguishing individuale
from each other.

But though our earliest complex notione may have
been gained from real objecto, there is uo reason why
such notione alone should be admitted in a theory of
Predication. Suchatbeory only distinguishes the several
relations which the subject and predicate of s proposition
may beer to esch other. With the objective existence of
things corresponding to our general notione, we have for
the present no concern. Whatever theory may be adopted
as to the origin oi our ideas, there can be no doubt that
we have the power os forming combinatione in the mind,
which have not been obserrcd to exist in nature'. And
thc relation oi subject and predicate in propositione into
which such notione enter, may he identified with some oi
the relations of other notione.

In constructing or explaining a theory of Predication
in conformity with these wiews, there is one ambiguity
which it is not possible to avoid, without a coinage of
new terms. The distinctions of Genus and Differentia
must be gained by comparing two terms not predicable
of each other. Ocmpere, for example, Man with Brute,
the common Genus will be Animal, the respective Diffe-
rentiae, Reticual and Irrational. But there is no absolute
Genus or Differentia, and frequently, while the whole
comprehension nithe noticn remains the same, the Genus
and Differentia may change places, according es itis
compared with this or that other notion. In the com·
parison, for example, of a plane triangle with a paral·
lelograrn, “ rectilineal figure'' is ita common, ‘f having
threc sides’' its distinctive part. But compare aplane
