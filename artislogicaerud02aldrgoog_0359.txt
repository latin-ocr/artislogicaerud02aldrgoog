proved by experiente to be universally necessary in
practice, both to the formation and to the eommunieation
of thought; and any defeat in this indispensable instru-
mentis eommunioated to the operatione which it per-
iorms. This was elearly seen by Aristotle and his
followers, who lrave assigned a prominent, indeed too
prominent, e pleae to language in their elassifioation, by
dividing Fauonios, iu the first instance, into those ia
dictione and those aetra dictionem according as the de-
eeption does nr does not depend upon the purtieular words
in whieh the ressoning is eonveyedl. Looking te the
actual position ol language in relation to thought, it will
he better to adopt a threefold division oi Fellaeies; those
in the Thought, those in the Mutter, and those in the
Languege; the last corresponding to the solloeioe io dic·
tione of Aristotle 3 the tvo former representing a still more
importent though often negleored disrmetion, which is
lost sight of in the vagus negetion of rutro dictionem.

ln the applieation of this prineiple of division to the

, several operatione of Thought, es exhibited in the follow·

ing Table, vome slight differentes will be observed,
which iu some instantes will explain themselves, while
in others a few preliminery words os explanation may
be desirable. Fellaeies of Language, it is obvious, will
beeome more numerandas the process oi thought be-
eomes more eomplieeted. While a Goneept een be
misappreheuded only in the term (whether 'expressed by
one werd or more) in whieh it is eonveyed, a Judgment
may be ambiguous, either iu the meaning of one of its
terme, or in its entire construction, and a Reasoning
admits of still further ambiguity, from the repetition of a
term nr sentence in different senses. Hence a different

enumeration of Fellaeies ia dictione will be required in
different parts of the Table.
