the plane where they meet is always a single point.”
“Two lines ean interseet eaeh other, and the plaoe
where they interseet is always a single point.”
(These ere properties of the point, and assumptions of
the possibility of angles.) “A straight line may lie in
and form part of a superficies.'’ Definitions xiii, xiv,

xvi, ere the only purely verba] ones3 t'or Definitions x,
xi, xii, and xvii, assume that straight lines oan 'be drawn
to eomply with oertain speoified eonditions3 aud the
others, being definitions ot figures, assume thet lines
under speoilied eonditions ean enolose a space.

The above remarks will suffioiently show in what
respeots the attempta of Geometers to dispensa with
axioms have failed. They have not been aware that
every synthetioal judgment assumed without demon·
stration is a axiom. They have attempted to deal, not
very suooessfully, with the expressed axioms of Euolid;
but they hare neglected, and in their own attempts have
assumed, principles equally axiomatio‚ though only
understood ‚- and they bave not been aware that an
assumption resting on au appeal to the senses or to
the imagination is as muah an unproved assumption as
one whiob appeals to the thought3 for of the one we
ean only say that we are so eonstituted that we eannot
but peroeioe it, and of the other, that we are so oon-
stituted that we oannot but think it.

An ingenious and iustruotive but unsuooessful attempt
of this kind ie made in General Thompson's ‘⁶ Geometry
without Axioms.’' The author every where identifies
intelligible magnitudes with sensible; and this identifi-
oation gives rise to a multitude of subordinate assump-
tione, inadmissible in striot demonstratiou, but which, if
. admissible, would be as muob axioms as any thing in
Euolid. By identilying intelligible magnitudes with
sensible, it is implied thet all tlte persentiens whioh are
