The Demonstrations ol' Geometry cre still extant in the
same form in which they existed in the deys of the
Stagirite. Thougb Euclid himself, the oldest remaining
Geometer, is a few years younger than Ausones, yet,
except on the very improbable hypothesis that he was
the original inventor of the whole contents of his
Elementa, that work must be regarded ss fumishing a
fair specimen of the demonstratione treated of in the
Posterior Analytios. By this touohstone‚ Aristotle and
his interpreters may be tested. When any modern
Herlinus or Dasypodius¹ shall exhibita single demon-
stration of Euclid in the form of e scholastio demonstratio
potissimo, we may then recognise this foundling of the
Sohoolmen as the legitimete offspring of their master.
Till thet is done, we must continue to believe that
Aristotle was sufficiently acquainted with the use of his
own instrument, to be able to give a correct Logical
Analysis of the Demonstrations of Geometry.

r Euclid flourished in the reign of Ptolemy Lagus‚B.C. set-283. This
period, however, probably corresponds to the close, not to the oommenoe·
