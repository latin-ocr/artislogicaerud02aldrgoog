the sun’s light is intercepted by the eurth. What is
en eclipse? Au interceptiug of the sun's light from the

moon by the enrth. Thnnder in the sume wey is defined,
ἇῐίσβεσις πυρὸς lv νέφει, the enewer to the question tul rl

This kind of definition‚ es hus been obserred, differs
froin u demonstretion in the position (θέσις) oi its
termsl; for it hes the semo terms (ἔκλειψις, ἀντίφραξις,
σελήνῃ-βροντή, defodere πνςὸς, νέμῃ) but not in the semo
order, end with some variety of grammaticel form (πῶσιςὶ).

The Definition, then, of en Attribute is to be found iu
its Oeuse. But the Aristotelian Philosophy recoguises
four causes, end sometimes more then one of these is
concerned in the productiori of the seme effect. Which
of these is to be taken es the Definitionl ln Anul. Post.
ii. ll. Aristotle shows thet any one of the four mey be
used es e middle term in demonstration3 but itby no
means follows thet esch moy be u Definition of the mejor
term. On this point, Aristotle’s opinion is not decidedly ·

‘¹ Omne corpus illuminatum eb uli0,iuter quod et eorpus illuminans opscum
corpus sic interponitur, ut umbre opaci corporis operiet et comprehendet
corpus illuminatum, eclipsstur seu privetur suo lumine.”

i The Definition is by some given es ¹⁸ en obscuretion of light in the
moon, ceused by the interpositioo oi the eerth.” But in this cese, the
medor term of the Demonstrative Syllogism is not‘⁴eclipsed,” but “ob-
scured.'' Ii these two terme ere synonymus, the Definitionis merely
uominul, eud the letter pert superducam if not, we do not defice the
attribute demonstratori (obscuration), but another (eclipse), ooninned under
it as species under genus. I interpret Aristode's words se referring to ilie
complex form oi the Definition, ss given in question eud ausser, or ine

the conclusion ol e Demonstration, es containing, in the seme form, only

Aristotle's text is not decisivo, the one view being rather supported by
