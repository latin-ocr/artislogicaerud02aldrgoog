name among the Schoolmen: the triumph of Nominalism
involved the downfall oi the prinoipal applicatione of
' the scholastio method. Buridan, his disciple‚ tha reputed
author of the sophiam called Atinas Bastetana, deve-
loped the doctrines of Nominalism tn a still further χ
extent, but has the character of having pushed to an
extreme point the subtletias distinctiva os the scho-
lastic system. Another philosopher of the same period,
Walter Burley, is the author of some commentar-ies nn
the Legio and Physics of Aristode, and deserves mention
as the author of an attempt to extend the narrow his-
torical knowledge of the period by a work entitled
de cita et moribus philosophorum et poetaram. This
work, of which the philosophica] portion extends from
Thales to Seneca, is in part compiled from Laertius,

more complete form than that which is now extenta.

Agricola, and Ludoricus Vives, successively attached
the system in 1tto,1516·,and 1531. Their attacks
were directed, partly against the Latinity, partly against
the matter of the School Logia. The additions proposed

by these reformare are chiefly rhetorical innovatione
from Cicero and Quintilian.
