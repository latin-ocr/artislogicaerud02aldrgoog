and 01 maa 10 0101100110 0101000011 111 1110 second intention
penas 01000010. First 1010011000, as conceptione 01 things,
are predicable 01 1110 individuale conceived under them.
Thus we may say, “Socrates is man, animal, dc.’' Second
intentione 01000100 predicable: we cannot say, “Socrates
10 species, genus. dc? Hence when we 010 told theta
predicable is commune, univocam, 00000110 interitionis, it is not
100001 that 011 universale are in 1101001000 second intenticns;
but that every predicate 0101001 in relation to itr mlp'cct may be
comprehended under one 01 Porphyry’s five classes 01 010-
dicables; all which are second intentione. So when Genus
is said 10 be predicable 01 Species, it 10 001 010001 that we can
predicate the 000 second intention 01 1110 011101, 00 00 10 say,
¹· Species 10 Genus;” bnt that the first intention ‘⁸ animal ’¹ is
predicable 01 1110 first intention “mam'' the relation 01 1110
000 10 1110 011101 being expressed by the second intentione
⁸⁸ genus” and ⁸· species.'' For this reason Logic was said 10
1100101 mered intentione applied to first. See Aquinas, Opusc.

’1110 distinction between first and second intentions is
generally considered 00 01 Arebian origin. And 11110 10
perhaps true, as 101 as regards 1110 assigning 01 0000οἀ
intentione as the proper object matter 01 Logic. In this
point 01 view, Avicenna, in the beginning 01 1110 Legio, dis
tinguishes between those essences 01 things which are in the

things themselves, and those which are in the intellect; and,
in the second chapter 01 1110 Metephysics, says, “ Subjectum
Logicoe sunt intentiones intellectae secundo, quer apponuntur
intentionibus 011100 intellectis, secundum hoc quod per ees per·
venitur de cognito ad incognitum.'’ Bnt 1110 distinction 110011,
and even 1110000101000110 found 0100110011101. Boethius, in 1110
