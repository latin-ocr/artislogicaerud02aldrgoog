combined with the universality of their aims, aud the
consequent failura of each in the attemptto resolve dilli-
culties beyond their respective provinces-all this could
hardly fail to produce a spirit of scepticism, which should
eud in dauyiug the possibility of attaining to trutlr at
all‘. The decline of the philosophy of things was
naturally accompanied by a corresponding rise ol the
method of words: the denial of all real truth stimulated
the invention of verbal devioes for producing the appear·
anca of truth as occasion might require. Such was the
origin of the eristic method of the Sophiste. They
employed it chiefly to euforce their leading dogma of
the unreulity ol all knowledge, speculative or practical.
Accordingly, they endeavoured, by ingenious applicatione
of the dialectic mode of reasoning, to involve those with
whom they disputed iu seli-contradictions and ab·
surdities3 thus contributing at the same time to under-
miue all fixed principles of knowledge, aud to procura
a temporary triumph for the disputant. With these
practioal applicatione oi the dialectic method, seem to
have been coupled corresponding speculatione ou the

theory os thought, and ol its exponen,t,language; traces of ,

which remaiu iu the doctrine attributed to Protagoras,
dauyiug tha possibility oi falsehood in opinion or
speech, hom the absence of any objectiva reality iu
things¹²; aud in the theory noticed by Plato in the
. cratylus, which, almost anticipating the views of Hobbes
and Goudillao, declared the knowledge ol things to be
dependent ou the right use of wordsl. At a later period,
the eristic method was adopted aud pursued to a cou-
siderable extent by Euolid of Megara, and his successore
Eubulidas, Diodorus Oranus, Alexiuus, and Stilpo.
