anelcgous ιο that cf drawing formal insomnem, cirtuclly
contained in their promises, though not explicitly de·
veloped'. It is a process of seli-examinatius, not dis-
similar to the Platonis application cf Dialectic‚ though
widely differing es regards the objectiva truth ot' its
results. For the Logieal process furnishes only a sub·
jective criterion: it enables us to represent more dis-
tinotly ιο the mind, the notione previously existing there
in more or less confusion: its rules direct us ιο compare
concepte one with another, aud fumish some security
for our own consistency in employing them3 but they do
not enable us ιο ascertsin their accordence with external
abjecte, or to add the deficient parts, where they ere
inadequate representatives of the letter. The mind, like
the sky, has its nebulae, which the telescope cf Logic
may resolve into their component sters. But here the
parallel cesses. The Logical instrument discovers uo
luminary whose reys have not previously entered the
eye; it tells us nothing of their relative distsrrces‚ of
the velocity with which their light trevels; of aoy thing,
in short, which did not sonu a confused portion of the
sensuous representatioul. This may seem but beggarly
service tube performed by the Art of Arts and Scieuce
of Sciences. inferior certainly itis ιο the gigantis pur-
poses which more then one Logicel Titan has esseyed
ιο accomplish with the same instrument. But let not its
legitimate uses be contemned‚ because it has abated
somewhat of the “veulting ambition which c’erleeps
itsell'.” Ιι lurnishes the mculd by which the ever·
accumulating matter os consciousness is reduced ιο form
and consistency: it were ungratelul to despise it, because
it does not also dig the metal itself from the mine.
