duabus propositionibus pluribusve, ex quibus quicquid electum
fuerit, contrarium esse non dubium cst.” uf. Victorinus in

was certainly employed as synonymous vvith the compleris of
Cicero, (de Inv. 1. 29.) This is expressly stated by Servius.

similar sense by thc‘Grsek rhetoricians. See Hermogenes,
de Inv. p. 167, ed. Walz; Apsines, Ars Rhea p. ⁶24. In this
sense it may be defined, (omitting the adversnry, as belonging
rather to Rhetoric or Dialectic than Legio) “t syllogism,
having a conditional major promise with mors than ons
antecedent, and a disjunctive minor.” Its different forms
