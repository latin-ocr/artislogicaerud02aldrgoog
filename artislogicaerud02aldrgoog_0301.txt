As regards the aooount of the Enthymeme in the ·
Prior Aualytios, 1 am not enare that any further expla-
uatiou is neededl. But in the eorrespouding ohapters ol
the Rhetorio one or two diffioulties romain, an elnoida·
tion of which, though not striotly within my present
province, may perhaps bo servioeahle to the readers ol
tho latter Treatise. ·

ln Rhet. i. 2, 18. we are told, that when the Enthymeme
is in the third figure, the σημεῖον is to its eonolusion as a
partioular to en universal. lu the seeoud figure, ou the
other hand, es au universal to a particular. The relation
in the first figure is not mentioned, but the oontext seems
rather to oonneet it with the former than with the latter.

This passage may be interpreted in two ways. Either
we may eomparo the oonolusion oi the Enthymeme
with the σημεῖον itself, or with the major promise ol
that Syllogism whose minor is the σημεῖον. In the former
interpretation the word σημεῖον is used properly for the
proposition ,· in the letter widely, for tho ressoning of
which suoh proposition forms a portion.

lf the first interpretation be adopted, (whioh seems

preferable,) we must compare the two propositione
relatively to that· term in whioh they are unlile; i. eil

demnation seeum to be made on logioal grounds. The loyieul velue ol two
affirmative promises in the seeond figure is absoluto seror whereas the
σημεῖον in the third ligure, though faulty as employed to pronoen universal
oonelusion, is valid lor particulare. For rhetorical purposes, however, the
seoond figure is also admissible; an aeonmulshon ol Enthymemes all
lopioolly worthless, may amount to a moral certainty.
