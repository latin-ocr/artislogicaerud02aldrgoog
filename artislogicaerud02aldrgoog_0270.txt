ln some passages, speaking in a strieter sense,lAristotle
declares Substsnces alone ιο be capable of Definition⁸ ;
botin the wider sense of the term which prerails through-
out the Posterior Analytics, it is applicable both to
Substances and tc Attributee. ln both ceses the inquiry
into the Definition of a thing is identical with that into
its oause; with this distinction, that in the cese of
Attributes, the Causa is to be sought, not in the Attributer
bnt in its Subjeet3 whereas in the case cf Substanccs
which exist per se, the Caute is ιο be sought in themselves
only¹.

Attributes ere defined by the same cause which scrvcd
as a middle term ιο prove their existence. This is the
mode of Definition described as συλλογισμὸς τοῦ rl lert,
πῶσο διαφᾶςον τῆς ἀποδείξεως. Aa an example, hc gives
the definition cf an eclipse. lhe moon is proved ιο be
eclipsed, because the sun’s light is intercepted by the
earth. The same cause iumirhes us at once witha
middle term for demonstration‚ and with a definition of
the attributc¹. Why ie the moon eclipsed? Because

From this itwill be seen that Mt. Mill bas unjcstly monsed Aristotle cl
maintaining that the science ol Geometry ie deduoed hom Definitions.
(Mill's logio, vol. i. p. 197.) ΙΗοοοο may also be explained the conhadietion
rrhioh Stewart professes ιο find in Aristode's doctrines. (ElementsgPt. ii.
ch.8.sect.i.) The principles from wttcl Aristode demonstrates,are Aerem,

remainders are equsl.” The necessity ol amatae the existence ot the
subject is maintained hy Aristode es clearly as by Mr. Mill. (ll. also
