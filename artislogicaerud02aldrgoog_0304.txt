Secondly, it may be obserred that the Enthymeme ie
not necessarily confined to the Rhetorica} kind of matter.
A syllogism from likeliboods or signe, whatever be the
object, is en Enthymeme. In like manner, any syl·
logism in probeble matter mey become an instrument of
Dialectic reasoning3 whether it be based on the general
prohabilitiee which Dialeotic materially furnishee, or on
more limited assumptione drawn from special observ·
atione. The Physician, for example, within the field oi
hie own experience, may know that in nine ceses out
of ten where e patient exhibite certain symptome, the
diseaee terminatos fatally. The student of history may
learn thet in the majority of cases revolution leads to
enerohy, and anarohy ie suppressed by despoliem. Eitber
of these may become tho basis of a reasoning process
in proheble mutter3 but the Syllogism or Entbymeme ie
not, properly speaking, Dialeotieel or Rhetorioal, but
Medical or Politioel. And although there is nothing in
the Dialectical or Rhetorical Method that prevente ite
being applied to these or any other special subjecte, yet
in proportion ae any one so applies it, Aristotle regards
him ae deperting srom the legitimute matter of Dialectio
or Rhetoric, und adopting thet of some definite Art or
Scienoet For the same reason, when he speaks of the
special application os Rhetoric to Politice] deliberation,
he werne ue thet ite object matter must not be con-
sidered es tbut of Rhetoric per se, but es primerily
end properly belonging to Politice, escenderily only to
Rhetoric in oue of its practieul applicatione·.
