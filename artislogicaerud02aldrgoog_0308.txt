easily stated in such a form, as to transfer the material
difficulty from the minor prernise to the major; in which
case the question may bc satisfactorily answered by that
Art or Science to which the Proposition materially
belongs. Thus the example given by Aldrioh might be
stated as lollows:

The magneta which I have observem and also those which
I have not observed‚ attract iron;

The magneta which I have observedJ and those which lhave
not observod‚ are all magnets;

therefore, All magnete attract iron.

In this mode of stating‚ the minor premiae is unde-
niably true. The doubtful partos the major, relating to
the properties of unobserved objects, must be determined
by the analogice of the Seleuco to which the objecta
belong, and by the material inquiry, what kind of
samples or specimens will warrant our asserting of

others what we have observed in them.

ll. It is precisely in the mode of answering thia
material inquiry‚ that the whole differeuce lies between
the ancient Inductio per enumerationem rintplicem, end
that interpretation of Nature insisted upon by Baoon.
The disciple of the former method‚ when ashcd, How do
you know that other specimens of your class possess the
same property ss these? will reply, Because 1 have
never seen one which does not possess it. The Ba·
conian‚ on the other hand, will answer, Because I hare
selected such instanoes as give evidence of an universal
law: I have examined those specimens of the class
which have nothing in common, except the possession
of the property in question: Ihave compared them with
objeots not possessing it, and 1 find its absence always
accompanied by that of one of the essentia] attributes
of this olass⁸.
