In treating the doctrino of Prodicables, two alter·
nativas are open to the modern Logioian. Either be
may take the scholastic language aa he finds it, and
explain it with reference ιο the theorias on which it
was originally founded; waming, however, at the same
time bis readers or hearers, that the supposed Raal
Essences are deserving of the same amount of belief
as the Daities of Heathau Mythology, or the Sylpbs,
Guomes, and Salamandcrs of tbe Rosioruoians3 or he
may adopt a theory of Universals in conformity with
riews current iu modern philosophy, and remodsl th'e
whole account of the predicables, so as to make it
consistent therewith. But any attemptata compromise
between the two, any explanation of ancient languagc
upon modern hypotheses, can produce nothing but in-
consistency in the Teacber and confusion in the Pupil.
ln the first place, such explanation, even where most
satisfactory, is founded merely on analogy, and hence
will rather show what the doctrines expounded ought
to bave been, according to modern triticiam, than what
they actually ware. ln tha second place, the analogy
in some important particulare will fail entirely, and
the exceptional cases must either by some unnatural
distortion be forced under the giren olassification, or
be excluded altogether, to the serious detriment of the
completeness cf the theory.

To adopt then the first mode of explanation. We will
suppose that Genera and Species are substances, haring
a real existence independently of us, and cognisable as
ιο their nature, no matter how, by the human mind. Of
these universal substances, some are more extensive,
others less so, the limits at both extremities being fixed
by nature, and the numbers in each degree settled and
