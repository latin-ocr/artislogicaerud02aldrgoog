as they come within the province of Logia, are governed
by the same lavvs, we may naturally expect ιο find some
resemblance between the illegitimate forms of each.
The resemblance, as will be seen hereaftcr, is by nc
means perfect3 bnt tbe saruc general principles of classi·
fication will be found applicable ιο tbc various praeesses

, of Thougbt, whether wa are examining their legitimate

or their illegitimate results.

The first and most obvious principle of division is
into Formal and Material Fallacies, according as the
source of the deceptiou lies in tbe act of thought itself,
or in the object upon which, or the circumstances
under which, it is exarcised. Strictly speaking, Formal
Fallaciae alone come under the cognisance of tbe Lupias
doceas, or Logic properly so oalled; as being apparent
but not real thoughts, or at least not the kind of thoughts
which tbey profess to be. Material Fallacies, where
the thought is legitimare, but the relation to things
inaccurate, belong properly to the province of the Lopicu
atem, and can only be adequately guarded against by
that brauch of knowledge which takes cognisauce of
the things. Α minute division ol Material Fallacies
may thus be carried on toan indefinite extent3 for any
object about which wa tbinlr may be represented in
thought inaccurately or nntruly. The Logiciau must
content himself with indicating the most general prin·
ciples of such a divisiou3 and that not strictly as a
portion of the theory of his seleuce, but as a hint for
its application to practice. To these two classes of

Fallacies, which are those which suggest themselves '

o priori, as implied in the idea of any possible exorciso
of thought, it becomes necessary in practice to add a
third class, comprising those which arise from the
ambiguities of languaga. Words, whether written, cr
