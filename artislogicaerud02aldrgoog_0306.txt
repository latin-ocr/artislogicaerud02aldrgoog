lnnucnos, as far as it is a Logical process at all, is
equally formal with Syllogism3 though proceeding in
the inverse orden viz. from the aggregate of individuale
to the universal whole constituted by them3 instead of
from the whole ιο the several individuale contained
under it. It is defined by Aristotle, “ proving the major
term of the middle by means oi the minor⁸;'’ in wbieb
delinitiou, the expressions major, middle, and minor, are
used relatively to their ectenias, to designate respectirely
the attribute proved, the constituted species of which it
is proved, and tbe aggregate of individuale by which tbe
speeies is constituted. The form in which the inductiva
Ressoningb naturally appears, exhibite sn apparent,
though not a real, resemblance to the third figure of
Syllogism. Thus:

X, Y, Z, (minen) are B (major);
X, Y, Z, are all A(midd1e); therefore,
All A is B.

The resemblance ιο the third figure is apparent only;
the true distinctions being, l. That in the minor promise
oi the Inductiou, the copula does not represent the
subject as contained under, but as constitutine, the

predicate. 2. Thetin consequence os this distinction,
