De Syllogismis Hypclhetioirt

ᾗ. l. Syllogismus Hypotheticus, est in quo una,
duae, vel tres propositiones hypotheticae„ v. g. Si
septemburias: Sapit,· ergo est matus. Vel, Qui
sapit cst hectm: Si est Philosophus, sapit ,· ergo Si
est Philosophus, est beatur. Vel, Si sapit, est beatiss:
Si cst Philosophus, sapin ergo Si cst Philosophus,
ecthactus. Nos de eo tentum loqui instituimus
qui est caetcris usitatior, in quo nempe Major
Hypotheticab.

· Hypotheticnl syllogismo, in the present sense ol the term,
ure not treated ol by Aristode. An exposition of them rsus
first sketched out by Theophrastus, which rsus eltorwnrds
further developed by Eudemus und the Stoice. None ol these
works, however, heve come down to ns. Alew notices may
be gethered from the Greek commentatum but our principsl
extent authority on the subjectis Boethius. Ol the συλλο-
ysupcl ἐξ ὑποθέσεως os Aristotle, which Pacius hue oonsounded,
and M. St. Hileire attempts to identily, with the hypotheticels
of Theophrastus, some account will be giren in the Appendix,
note 1. In the Prolepmneuo Lopioa, I have given a theory
ol hypotheticnls different lrom thet commonly adopted by
Ι logiciuns. But thot theory, though 1 believe it to be more
occurste then thet of Aldrioh, differe too widely from his
text to be edmissible here. Iheve therefore trnnslerred it
to the Appendix, note 1.

⁸ This is the only kind of hypotheticnl syllogism in which
the conclusion is categoricnl. u the minor promise, or both
promises, ure hypotheticni, the conclusion is so too. A
syllogism with ull three propositions hypotheticel wus called
by Theophrastus, δι’ ὅλου mutante, (Scholia, p. 179. e. 16.)
