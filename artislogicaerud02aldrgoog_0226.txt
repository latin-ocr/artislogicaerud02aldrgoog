Aristode himself observes, is not drawn syllogisticolly.

¹ The Elanchus is defined by Aristotle, συλλογισμὸς ἀπι-
φάσιωε. An. Pr. ii. 20. l. Soph. Elench. 6. 4. The Ignoratio
Elenchi consists in neglecting some oi the conditione required
by the rules of Dialectic sor proving the contradictory of any
given proposition. This is tha csse when the conclusion dees
not logically follow irem the premises; or when the promises
themselves are not admitted by the opponent: or when the
conclusion, though legitimately deduced from allowed pre
misas, is an apparent, not a real, contradiction oi the op-
ponent's position, failing in one oi the four conditione ol
contradiction, viz. codem moda amandum idem ad idern eodem
ternpore. In this extended sense, every fallacy is an Ignoratis
Elenchi, as is observed by Aristode, Soph. Elench. a. l. though
the name is especially applied to the last instance.

¹¹¹ This sallacy, according to Aristotle, most frequently occurs
in tha deductio od impossibile, and consiste in pretending that
the proposition which we wish to refuta is the cause ol the
false conclusion, which in reality follows from other promises:
i, s. in maintaining that the conclusion is false because thot
maenomenon is lalse. This mode oi deception has
place in dialectical disputation, from the praetiosos esking

the opponent to grant certain premisse. hu unnscassary
proposition is aslred and granted among tho rost, and alter·
