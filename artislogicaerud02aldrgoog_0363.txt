sible truth that some B is uot t. Hence the same
heliel is regarded as possible and impossible at the
same time ; and thus the conclusion, though not directly
at rariance with what thc promise assub, cannot be
drawn consisteutly with what it pertrita. Hence these
and cognate forms of reasoning are classed in the Tabla
as violating the st os Contradiotion indireotlpr and the
conclusion is noted as sormally invalid, though mate-
rially it may be either true or salse. Thus the whole
process may be velid as a series of judgments, but not
aa a reasoning3 and the thought, therefore, is uot the lrind
of thought which it professes ιο be. On the other haud,
it a conclusion is drawn opposed to that which the lawe ·
οἱ thought require, the conclusion is neither materially
nor sormally possible; and the supposed reasoning isin
rcality no thought at all. Thus we may, rerbslly at least,
argue, “All A is B,O is A, therefore O is not B;” which
requires us ιο conceive cas being at the same time B
and not B. Here the Lau of contradiction is violated
directly. The relation os logical fallacies ιο this lew
will be seen much more clearly, it, in accordante with
the system os Sir William Hamilton, we assign to the
predicate as well es to the subject ot every proposition
an expressed marlr of quantity.

To attempt a complete enumeration of Material
Fallaeies would be an endless as well as a profitless
taslr. Under the head of Reasouiug, it has been thought
sufficient to strange iu their proper places the members
of the usually received list. The arrangement has been
mede according to the instances pren by Aldrich aud
other modern Logicians‚ as beiirg most familiar to the
majority of readers. These, however, occasionally differ
in points of detail from those which are found in the
originel text of Aristotle. The discrepancy is ol little
