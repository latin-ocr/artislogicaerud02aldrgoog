ternis, are not examined, but assumed3 and the only pos-
sible logical fault must consist in drawing a conclusion
incompatible with the promises themselves, or with sorne-
thing which they imply. ln these two cases, the only
possible instances cf inccnoeirability must ariae from
a direct or indirect contradiction. ,

Α Fallacy, according to Aristode, is areasonlng which,
either in matter or form or both, appears tc be that
which it is nott Extending this delinition from the
process of reasoning to that ol thought in general, we
may regard any thought as fallacious, which, in form or
matter, has an apparent but not a real validity3 and a
Logical cr Formal Fallacy is one which exhibita an ap-

An apparent thought may thus be formally fallacious in
two ways 3 either generally, because it is not a thought
at all; cr specially, because it is not the lrind of thought
which it professes to be. For the elementa ol a judg-

“All A is B, G is not A, therefore Ο is not B,” it is
obvious that the three statements, riewed merely as judg-

not A, or that everyB must be A. Whereas the premise,
in stating that all Ais B, leaves it open aa at least a pos-
