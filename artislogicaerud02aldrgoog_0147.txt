¹ The logical, as distinguished lrorn the grammatical pro
position, is properly ol the form distinguished as tcnr'i
adjacentis, and the copula is always in the present tense.

For Logic considers words onlyas the signs of thought: and , ¹

the copula indicates the present union ol two notione in the
mind ol the thinker, not the past or future connection ol
laets narrated or predicted. Every proposition should there
lore, before conversios, be stated in the lorm A ie Β, which
by conversion becomes B ie Α, with a change, il necessary,
in thequantity. To give more minute directions would be
ιο enoroach upon the province ol the Grammarian: we must
be guided by the idiom ol the language we are using. In
Latin, e. g. the substantive acquires an adjective power, and
the adjective a substantive, without change ol form: e. g.
‘⁴ nullus sapiens est iracundus,'' “nullus iracundus est sa·
piens.'' In English we must say, ‘⁸ No angry mun is wise.''
Rules on this point are extra-logical.

The directions ol some Logicians as to the conversiones
past and future time, e. g. “nullus senex erit puer,'’ are also,
logically speaking. out ol place here, though practically helps
ιο abeginner. For these tenses not being logical copulae,
the sentence is not, as it stands, a logical proposition; and
should be reduced to such, before it comes into the hands ol
the convertet.

⁸ Aristotle's account ol conversion differs somewhat srom
this. He divides conversion into universal and particular,
according to the quantity ol the proposition alter consoneat.
Consequeutly E is converted anivercclly, A aad I particularly.
He does not recognise any conversion ol Ο. Simple con·
version, (ἁπλῆ interpretii) is mentioned by Philoponus, Scholia,
p. 148. b. 21. Boethius uses the terme pennalis and per uc
cidem In the system ol Sir W. Hamilton, by assigninga
quantity to the predicate ol every proposition, the various
kinds of conversion are reduced to that os simple conversion
alone.
