which our intuition, whether pure or empiricul, presente

As eu appropriate conclusion to this note, 1 subjoin e
specimen of Euclid reduced ιο syllogismo, extracted
from the very curicus end rere Anolyser Geometricce of
Herlinns end Desypodius. 1 heve selected the fifth
proposition of the first boch, es thet which hes also
been nnslysed by Mr. Mill¹. Το the curicus in such
subjecte it moy be interesting to compare the two
demonstratione.
