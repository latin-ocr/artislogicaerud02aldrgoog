not treated ol in the logical writings of Aristode, with the
exception oi a few rules for the arrangement (τάξις) os e dialee
tioal disputation in the eighth book os the Topioe. alost
treatise. called Methodieo‚ is mentioned in matthanian 2.
Method‚ es a distinet partos Logio‚ was first introduced by
Remus, and from him passed to the logical writings of the
,Oertesians and oi Gessendi‚ by whom it was treated as a
fourth part of Logio. Like most of the additions to the
Aristotelian system, it was originally the property of the
Rhetorieiaus.

1 Method hae been treated ol by Logioians in two prinoipal
senees. 1. Aa aprooess ol inserenee from the known to the
unknown; which is the earlier sense os the term, and sane·
tioned by Aristotle and his Greek interpreters. 2. Ae au
arrangement os truths already known, with a view of eoru·
munieating them to others. The last corresponds to the
Greek τάξις, end should rather be called Ordo. It is distin·
guished from the first by Zuburellu end others. Aldrieh'e
definition corresponds only to the second sense ol Mettodur:
but in his subsequent division he eonsounds it with the first.
