Methodus Doctriuae duplex est. “Persectudrpou-
μοτικὴς οι Inperfecta, ἓξωτερική. Perfecta rur-
sus, vel universalis est, qua integra disciplina, vel
particulare, qua aliqua disciplinae pars docetur.
Utraque duplex est.

plicsble ιο mixed sciences os reasoning and fact. of. Fries,

. system der Lapis, ᾖ. ll'l.

l The Methodus Doctrinae is notin the same sense n process
os inlerence from known ιο unknown; for the parts are sup
posed ιο be known already to the toacher, and are methodically
arranged for the benefit ottho learner. This then corresponds
rather ιο Order than to Method in the proper sense. It msy
be sn arrangement either of the whole or of a portiones a
subject: and is thus either universal or particular. Gt.
Zabarella, de Methodis, lib. ii. cap. 20. The distinction
between the Perlect and Imperfect Method is not usually
recognised by writers on the subject. Aldsich is thinking ol
the acroamatic und crateris teaching ol Aristotle und others;
the characteristic feature oi the latter being the suppression
of certain doctrines as not fitted for a promiscuoue audience.
Whereas the universal und particular Methods merely relate
ιο the whole and the parts in the sama exposition.

⁶ On Synthesis and Analysis, and the various employment
of both, some remarks will be found in the Appendix‚ nota G.
The notion of Synthesis in the present passage corresponds
ιο that of Metaphysicsl parts and whole, which is there men·
tioned⁸as spplicable to s syllogistic process from a general
principle ιο its particular application. Not so that of Analysis;
which in thepresent passage is alsoa process from the universal
to tho particular, not from the particular ιο the universal.
By Euhenum is meunt the most general Subject whose pro·
perties the Science investigates; ss Magnitudo in Geometry.
