certain conditions; but it does not become an Art until
those conditione arc oornplied with, and it may exist
as a Scienoe without them. The ordinary distinction
between theman ol theory and the man ol practice is a
proof of this. Antan may have a scientific knowledge
of music, and yet hare no power ol' playing on any
instrument. He may be acquainted with the principles
of perspectiva, without any skill iu the use of the pencil.
He may know the mathernatical principles oi Optics,
and yet be sadly at a loss if required to make a pair oi
spectacles. Hc may hare studicd the anatomy of the
human frama, and yet be unable to perform a surgical
operation. He may talk like a Curius, and lire like a
Bacchanal. And in like manner, he may be familiar
with Barbara, Color-ent, and Burulipton, but in practice
,be a wcak and inconclusive reasoner. On the other
band, he may possess Art without Science, that is to say,
he may bare considerable dexterity in the practice ol
any operation, without being able to give a clear account
of the principles on which itis conducted. Science
is no more Art because the man of sciense may become
an artist, than a boy isa man because he may grow.up
into onc. Nay‚ far less so; for the boy becomes a man
in the course of nature, without any effert ol bis own;
while the man ol theory may remaiu a man of theory all
his lile, without ever learning to apply his knowledge to
practice. '
When we are asked, What is Logia? it is clearly
meant, What is the object ol which books on Lugio
treat. No treatise on Logic can give all its practieal
applicatione. lt can at best select only a lew speci·
mens, and these by way of example, not as an essential
part of the theory. But it professes to gire, and is
bound to give, the entire principles of reasoning, or
rather of thinking in general, even though it illustrates
