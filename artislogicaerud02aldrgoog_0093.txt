Singulis operationibus sui accidunt defectus¹.

The definition is too wide, being applicabis to the immediate
inserences oi Opposition snd conversim, as well as to the
mediate by Argumentation. In all there is aprogress srom
one judgment to another. Discursus is more properly the
progress from two connected judgments to a third resulting
from their connection. steort Roysl Logic, Introd. “ On
appelle rabonner l’aetion de notre esprit, par laquelle il forme
un jugement de plusieurs autres.''

Oi this division oi the operatione of the mind, Sir W.
Hamilton has observed, that “it never was proposed as a
psyeboloys'cal distribution of the cognitive faculties ia penem:
but only as a lopicel distribution os that section oi them
which we denominate discursive, se those alone which are
proximately concemed in the process oi reasoning.'' Reid'r
Worles, p. 242, 692. Hence Aristotle’s division, which is
psychobpieal, will not exactly correspond.‘ The nearest ap
proach to Simple Apprebension is ἡ τῶν ἀδιαιρέτων νοήσας
but νοήσας is variously used, and in ite widest sense will
ombrsce all the logical operatione, and even φαντασία, which
belongs ratberto the perceptive eoul. Scede Anima, iii.
3. 8. Judgment will correspond nearly to the ὑπόληψις ol ds
Aa. iii. 8. 7. (of. Trendelenburg, Aristeia Anime, p. 469.)
The latter term however is inapplicsble to the cognition ol
axiomatic truths. Discursus answers to διάνοια and λογισμός,
the former term being applied both to the faculty and its
operation. But there is much uncertainty in the use ol all
the above terme. Of. Biese, vol. i. p. 89, 827. Hamilton's
Reid, p. 768.

¹The service supposed to be performed by Logic in
relation to these three desecte is more iully and clearly stated
