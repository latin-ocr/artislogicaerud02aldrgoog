Universal Propositions. It will be sufficient, however, for
my present‘purpose to observo that, unless the establish-
ment of an Universal Proposition requires an explicit
and consciens examination of every existing and also of
every possible particular instance, no charge ol Petitio
Principii, or even of vain repetition, can be maintained
against the Syllogism. Those who maintain the ante·
cedent, abendon themselves to an absolute scepticism¹;
and against such, no defence ol any source of human
knowledge can or need be attempted.

With regard to the syllogism of proos, we may examine
the question a little more closely. The Petitio Principii
is a material, uqt a formal fallaoy, and consists in
assuming, in demonstration, a non-axiomatio principle
as axiomatic, or in dialectic disputation, a non-probable
principle as probable¹. lt does not effect the form of
the reasoning 3 bnt depends on the selection of premiscs,
when the syllogism is employed for the particular
purpose of proos, demonstrative or dialectie. Those
ure guilty ol it who do not adopt such premises as the
laws ol the two processes require; in the one case,
propositione axiomatie or deducible from axioms; in the
other, probable statements, sanctioned by the general
opinion of mankind or the authority ol eminent persons.

In reading Aristotle's account of this fallaoy, it is
evideut that the whole point ol the matter lies in the word
altricius, or suplicium and that the question to be ashed
is, not whether the premises virtually contain the con·

¹ Sed erratione prorsus evertuntur scientim, et Sceptici vicere. Nam
nunqnam constitui possunt aa ratione propositiones perfecte universalem
quis inductione nunqnam certus es, omnia individua a te tentata essa; sed
semper intra hano propositionem subsistes, omnia illa, qnoe expertus sum,
sunt taliar quum vera non possit ease ulla ratio universalis, semper
manebit possibile, innumera, qnae tu non sis expertos, esse diversa-’¹
