be required to prore that some A is not B, ive reason
from the assumption of the conuadictory,

All A is B;
All G is A; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ irwodr‘oeos.)
Therelore, tlt 0 ia B.

The Conclusion being supposed to he a known false-
hood.

This mode of reasoning, aa exhibited by Aristotle,
does not directly appear in the same form aa the former.
For in this the hypothesis is a premise,· the conclusion
being the impossibility which has not been previously
enunciated. In the former, the premises araboth new
assumptions; the conclusion being the antecedentes
the conditional proposition whioh was agreed upon aa
a hypothesis. Both, however, agree thus far, that the
syllogistic portion of each dees not differ in form from
an ordinary Syllogism; and that in neither is the original
question syllogistically proved.

The notices of these Syllogisms in Aristotle are, it
must be conlassed, sufficiently scanty. Thus much,
however, may fairly be gethered. Firstly, that, as
regards ferm, they arc merely the common Cetegorioal
Syllogisms applied to a particular purpose. Secondly,
that their conclusiveness‚ as regards the original
question, is by way of material, not of semol conse-
quence. The syllogism by agreement obviously refers
to dialectis disputation, and furnishes the grounds lor
a mere arpumentum cd hominem, in consequence of a
previous admission, Apart from this special appli-
cation, which dees not appear iu the syllogism‚ the
proof amounts to this:

No X is O;
All X is A:
Therelore, Some A is not 0.
Therelore‚ (by material consequence) Some A is not Β.
