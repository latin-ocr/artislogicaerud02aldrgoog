This method vae alavourite vvith Plato: it vae rejected
ae uselena by Speusippns¹. Aristotle adopts an inter·
mediate course, limiting, however, its utility chiefly tc
two palata—the right arrangement of the several parte
nithe Definition‚ and the security thet nothing aasential
is omitted. It would thus seem to be useful, not so
much for dhcocemnp Definitione es for tertinp them1'3
and even in thie respect will be appliceble only to one
class of Definitiona, that of Substances by genus and
differentia. .

For discovery, the second method ie employed. Thia
is commonly called the inductiva Method; a name, how·
ever, not sanctoned by Aristotle himselfl. It consiste in
examining the several individuale ol which the term tc
be defined ie predicable‚ end obaerving what they have
in common. Il we can obtain one common noti0n‚ thia
ie the Definition senght3 if not, the object of inquiry ie
not one but many. This methodis equally applicabla
to Substencee end to Attributee, though Aristotle only
gives en example of the latter‚—the definition oi mag·
nenimity‚ gained by examining into the actione ol dif-
ferent magnanimous persons.

Another important remark ofArietotle’eie,thetalthough,
ae vve have already seen, demonstration, in eemaiu cases,
must always precede definition, yet no delinifica, aa
such, can be proved. This he maintaina at some length
(against Xenocrates¹)‚ in Auel. Post. i. 4. and shows that
