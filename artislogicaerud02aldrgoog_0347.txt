with an axium. Thus, ior example, to delinc a uiangle
as a rectilinear ligure of three sides involves the aa·
sumption thot three straight lines con enclose a space,
which is quite as much an axium as the assumption

thot two cannot. Again, to define au acute angled
triangle os one that has three acute angles involves the
assumption thot three straight lines inclined at acute
angles to each other will enclose a space. Accordingly
vve find in the ordinary editions of Euolid many of the
defiuitione accompanied by ligures, which furnish an
evidence oi the possibility of the conception by a direct
appeal to the intuition. So also the delinition, that “a
circle isa figure contained by one line which is called
the circumference, and is such that all straight lines
drawn from a certain point within the figure to the
circumference are equal to one another‚” involves the
assumption that a line so drawn as to be always equally
distant from a given point will return into itself or be
one line including a space ;-an assumption which
'might be more properly classed as an axiom than as a
definitum.

From this we may conclude that the numerous attempta
of Geometers to diminish or get rid of their axioms have
been steps in a, wrong direction¹. The number ol
axioma, instead oi being diminished, should be very
considerably increased3 and the errors that have hitherto
prevailed on the nature and foundation ol Geometrical
reasoning have been mainly owing to the manner in
. which many indispensable assumptione have been either
omitted altogether, or concealed among the defiuitione.
