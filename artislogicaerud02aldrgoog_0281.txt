every attempt at such demonstration necessarily involves
a petitio principii. The reason is obvious: since a
definition ean he predicated esseutially (ir τῷ sl ἐστι) ol
nothing but that of which it is a definiti0n; and since,
to prore a conclusion concamiug the esseuce, the pre-
mises must be of the same character3 the middle term
assumed mustbe identical with the minor, aud the major
promise with the conclusion.

Such is Aristotle's theory of Definition. Its sunda·
mental principle may still, metatis mutandis, he retained,
notwithstanding that the speculatione of modern philo·
sophy have cousiderahly modified his distinction of
Substanoes aud Attributes. Properly speaking, indeed,
all Definition is sn inquiry into Attribater. Our com-
plex notions of Substanoes ean· only be resolred into
various Attributes, with the addition of sn unknown
substratamr-a something to which we are compelled to
regard these Attributes as belonginge. Mon, for example,
is analysed into Animality, Rationality, and the some·
thing which exhibits these pheuomeua. Pursue the
analysis, and the result is the same. We have a some-
thing eorporeal, animated, sensihle, rational. An un-
known constant must always be added to complete the
integration3 unfortunately we have uo means of de·
terminiug its value. Still, this does not effect thebaeis
of the Aristotelian distinction. For some pheuomena
ean be accounted for by other pheuomenal causes: iu
others, we must acquiesce iu the conviction that they are
so, merely because they are. It is clearly impossible
for the mere hypothesis of an unknown substratum to
explain the reason of all the variety of attributes which
different objecta exhibit.

One further question remeius. How far Definition
properly belongs to the province of Logia, was, as we⁴
