an universal conclusion is logically drawn in this form,
which is not valid iu the third figure of Syllogiam.

We see then, thatin the lnductive process the Copula
is ambiguous, expressing in the major premise and in
the conclusion, the relation of a contained part to a con·
taining whole ; in the minor promise, that of constituting
parts to a constituted whole. This ambiguity has been
remarlred as a deficienoy in technieal lauguage⁰3 but
there is no term sufficientiy naturalized in Lugio to serve
as a substitute to express the latter relation.

On Induction, as exhibited above, it may be remarked,

Ι. Tbat the distinction between a perfect and an im·
perfect Induction is extralogioal. Logia recognises no
inference that is not necessitated by the Laws of Thougbt:
and therefore it must be presumed that the Induction is
perfect, i. e. that the Individuals mentioned are in reality
the whole constituente of the species, before the inductiva
Inference can come in any way within the province of
tbe Logician. To inquire what is tlre warrant for this
presumption, to ask what amount of observatiou will
narrant us iu assuming X, Y, and Z, to be ott the
members of the class A3 is like asking in syllogistio
reasoning, hovv do vve know that the premisse are true?
undoubtedly a most important question, but not to
be answered by Lugio. So also any cornpromise vvith
material probability, any statement of the individuale
as comples or adaquata representation of their class‘,
is a surrender of the esseutial principle of Logical
Reasoning: the parts ore absolutely the vvbole; or the
inference is, logically speaking, wortbless.

It is manifest, however, that the Induction may be
