position in space to another, and all their constituent
attributes with them; ior they contain no attribute
which is not presented in the imago. But the empirical
qualities 01 0 hard body cannot be constructed 0 priori

¹ in epure intuition3 and tangibility‚ which the author

adopts 001110 test 01 corporeity, cannot be conreyed into
the mental image by tha construction, nor conceived to
exist, so long aa it is transferred from one place to
another solely hy the imagination. 11 l draw two
triangles upon paper, 1 carr only show their coincidence
cr bodies by cutting one out and placing it on the other.
Thus the statemeuts 01 Geometry are reduced to empirioal

truths dependent on actual measurement3 a method quite
as applicable to theorema aa to axioma, and which, con·
sisteotly carried out, would dispensa with demonstration
altogether. For 11 Ι may prore by measurement that
maguitudes which ara equsl to the same are equal to

each other, I may apply the same test with equal direct·
neas to shew that the anglesei 0 triangle are equal to
two right angles.

Another work, nominally 01 0 similar character to that
01 General Thompson, hut differing considerably in its
method and actual results, was published in 1856, hy
Mt. Henaleigh Wedgwood, under the title 01 “the
Geometry 01 tha three first Books 01 Euclid by direct
proof from Definitions alone.’' The opposition, how-
ever, between the principles 01 Mr. Wedgwood's treatise
and those maintained in tbe preceding remarks is more
verbal than real. According to the view 01 Kant, which
hasbeen adopted in the preceding remarks, the science
