the object defined must iu every case be a Species. Summa
Genera and Individuals are in that case alone inde-
finable. And for this limitation‚ the authority oi Aristotle
may be cited. On the other hand, Loclcel assures ne
that this restrictiou is moncons, and that Simple Ideas
alone are incapablc of Definition⁰. 'Ibe dispute may be
reduced to a mere verbal question. For Aristotle does
not maintaiu that all Definitions must be by Genus and
Differentia‚ but only those oi Substanoes. In the pas·
suges vvhich seem to extend this rulo, Definition is used
in the narrow sense which has been previously men·
Ι tioned‘. For it is obvious, to take the iustanees adduced
above, that “ qncnohing” cannot be called the genus oi
“ thunder,” or “ interception” oi “ eolipse,” in the same

ὓ aney, b. iii. 4. 7, But Loolre has in this matter been anticipated by
Dementes, Princip. i. 10. Sir W. Hamilton (lleid's Wodrs, p. aad.) main-
taine thet Aristotle has said the same thing. It is dangerous to disputa
any thing which a man ol Sir William's learning professes to hare dis·
covered in ro vide u field as Aristotle. especially as he gives no references3
but ir the passage alluded to be Metuph. vi. 17. 7. one might be tempted to
hazard a different interpretation. 'l'dirafi seem rethor to be the clemente,
(ἁπλᾶ σάματι, Mat. vii. l. 2.) which have not, lilre compound substantes,
received a definite lorm, and thus are not deflnable. Gi. Plato, Theaet.
p. 206. c. But the words are not sufficiently decisivo to iurnish much
ground for any theory. Amore remarkable passage occurs in Occam’a
logie, Pt. i. ch. 28. “Ex praedictis sequitur quod nulla intentio qum est
precise communis rebus simplicibus carentibus compositione ex materia et
torma babet differentias essentiales; quia nou hebetpurtes‚ quemvis possit
babere multas differentias accidentales. Ex illo sequitur ulterius quod
nulla speeies qua est precise simplicium est definibilis definitione proprie
dicta, sive sit iu genere substantiae sive in quocunque alio predicamento?
This, conpled vith Occam's Conceptualist theory oi Universals, is not very
different thom Loclre's position containing Simple Ideas.

e By Simple Ideas,1.ocke meant all ideas derived immediately from
sensatico or reflectiou. In the formationes these the mind is wholly
passive, whereas in the formation from them oi Complex ldeae, it is active.
Among Simple Ideas derived lhom sensatior, he enumeratos aolidity,
space, figure, rest, and motion3 llum reflection, perception and volition;
trom both, plemma and pain.
