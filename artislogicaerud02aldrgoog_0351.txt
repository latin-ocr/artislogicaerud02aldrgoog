coaceieecl to exist in magnitudee regarded as modi·
fications of space may also be perceieed ιο exist in
similar magnitudes regarded as portione of bodies. The
perfect straight line and the perfect triangle aud the
perfect circle are not merely imaginable forms, but
tangible substancee. But it is further seeumed by the
author, that the sensible properties of bodies, whose very
existence ean only be proved by the testimony of expe-
rience, may exist, along with the Geometrical qualities‚ in
a manner in which experience hae never presented them.
Thus “ figures of all kinds, lines and points,” ere “ always
considered as exhibited on a hard body cf some kind,
which causes the position of the several parts or points
tc be fitted with relation to one another3 and will, on
occasion, be supposed ιο be turned about an assigned
point or points, in any manner thet cen be shewn ιο bc
practicable with the hard body on which they are under-
stood ιο be represented. Nevertheless, the applicetiun
of one object to another will, when required, be imagined
to talte place without bar of corporeel substance ;-tbst
ie ιο say, without'impsdiment hom the existence of
other parts than those it ie desired to compere.” In
other words, the surface of a solid and the linear boundsry
of a surfaee may be considered ad libitam as in orout “
cf connection with the bodies of which they form part,
retaining in both cases the sttributes of body, euch as
bardness. Surely such assumptione as these, be they
legitimate or illegitimate, ere ιο be treated as postulates
or exioms. At any rste they are not definitione.

But further: a Eody ie defined to be “any thing that
can be made the object cf touch ;” and a hard body ia
“ a body which resiste all change cf form.'’ But bodies
which resist all change of form arc assumed at the same
time not to resist all change of size; for the genesis of
