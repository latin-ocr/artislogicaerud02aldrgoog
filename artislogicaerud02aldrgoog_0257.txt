comprehended in a notion, we shall find sll four mem-
hers admissiblc where the Suhject os the proposition
has hoth comprehensiva and extension- i. e. is a complex
notion containing attributes, snd is predicahle of existing
objects. For its Predicnte may either express s whole or
a part cf the attributes comprehendcd in the Subject, cr
else some attribute not so comprehended, but possessed
by the objects cf which the Suhject is predicshle. In
the latter case, where the Suhject and Prcdicate arc
distinct in comprehensim, they may be either equsl or
unequal in extension.

The two first cases will correspond to the class of
Propositions cslled by Kant, Anslyticsl Judgments, 0
and by Mt. Mill, Verhnl Proposrition. ln these the
attributes composing the ‘medicata are spart or the ·
whole of those composing thc Subject. They therefore
depend solely on the Principle of Identity. If Animal
form part of the conception Man, the objects, whether
actual cr possible, thought under the letter ‘must neces-
sarily he identicnl with s portion os those thought under
the former.

Το avoid the introduction of new words, we may retain
the Aristotelian nomenclaturc of uenus end Definition tc
express the relation of Predicste to Subject in these two
classes of Propositions; though the former appellaticn, ,
for the reason stated above, is not altogether free from
objections. Under Definition may be also included a
class of Propositions which arc not, in the striot sense of
the word, Anslyticsl⁹‚ snd are not admitted by Aristotlc
to he Definitions proper; viz. those in which the Predicate
is a single term synonymous with the Subject.

The last two ceses will correspond to thc Syntheticsl
Judgments cf Kant‚ snd to the Res] Propositions of
