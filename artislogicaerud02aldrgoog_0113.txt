⁸ ⁴¹ Genus speciebus matario est. Nam sicut oes, accepta
forma, transit in statuam, ita genus, accepta differentia, trmvsit
in speciem.” Boethius dc siccem. But as logicians, vve are
not warranted in introducing any portionas the essenos ot
things, but only'ol concepta or peterat notione. The whole
essence ola concept is the sum ol the attributes which it
comprehende, and this can only be fully declared by its
definitioni, not, as Aldrich says, by mdes. The Genus or
maurici port oi two picen concepte, (to spesk of the material or
formal partos adopto concept is nonsense) is the snm ol
those attributes which ere common to both; as the differem
or somni port is composed oi those attributes which erc
peculiar to each. Thus. it there be given three concepts,
containing respectively the attributes, ab, cc, tc, o is the
genus oi the first compared with the second, t end c the
respective differences. But ii the first is compared with the
third. b becomes the common genus, c end c the respective
differences. In this, the only teneble logical pointel view,
there cen be no such thing as an absolute genus or
differente.

‘Neomare-conemur* This distinction is based on
the supposition thet certain attributes are necessasily con·
nected with others, from which they flow, as effect from
cause. Thus vinbdhy ves described in the scholastic philo·
sophy ns necessarily flowing from rationatity, in the same
manner as having the angles et the base equal to each other
necessarily results from the equality ol two sides in en
