nontradiotory propositione as alternatives, one of them
being disproved by a prosyllogism.

Either Some Α ie not B, or All A is B ; in which latter ease
All (l is h;
Therefore‚ All G is Β.

This oonolusion being manifestly false, we have no
ohoioe bnt to admit the other alternative. The pro-
syllogism in this oasa, as in the former, may be omitted,
if the falsehood of the alternative is evident without it.
We hare thus the Disjnnotire Syllogism.

We may agree therefore with M. St. Hilaire thus far,
that, though the form of the Hypotbetioal Syllogism is not
explicitly exhibited in the extant writiugs of Aristotle,
we hare nevertbeless the data from whioh it needs but
one step to develope it. Whethar that step was taken
by Aristotle himself in a lost work, or supplied by his
disoiples, is a point of little consequence3 though
external testimony ia decidedly in favour of the latter
supposition.

Farmore importantia a logioal point of view, is the
inquiry whether the hypothetioal syllogism‚ by whom-
soeret analysed, is a legitimnte addition to the forms
of reasoning aolrnowledged in Aristotle’s Organon; and
nonaequently, whether its omission ean fairly be oen·
sured as a definienoy in that beaune. On this question,
1 find myself compelled to hold an opinion different
from that of the Logioians whose views have been mainly
followed in the present worlr.

By Kent and his followerr, the Hypothetioal Pro-
positionis described as representing aform of judgment
essentially distinet from the Oategorioa13 the latter being
thoroughly assertorial, the former problematioal in its
constituent parts, assertorial only as regards the relation
between them. Two judgments, each in itself false,
