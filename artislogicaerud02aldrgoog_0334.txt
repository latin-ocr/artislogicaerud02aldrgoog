‘⁶ Msgnitudes equal to the adjacent exterior end interior
angles os a triengle are equal to esch other;

The three interior angles and two right angles are equal to
the adjacent exterior an'd interior angles;

Therefore‚ they are equal to each other.”

The major premise of this Syllogism is en immediate
deduction from the first exi0m3 thus:

⁴⁴ Magnitudes which are equal to the same ere eqnal to
each other;

Magnitndes eqnsl to the adjacent exterior and interior
angles are equal to the same;

Therefore, they are equel to each other¹.'’

Thet the true syllogistie analysis oi Geometrieel Demon-
strations will always be in this form, the axioms standing
as major promises, and the construetione in each cese
furnishing the proper minor, is evident. lt only remains
to see whether the textos Aristotle can be accommodated

to this interpretation ae well es to the other.

With some passages it evidently tallies much better.
The places in which the axioms ere mentioned in
connexion with demonstration have never been satis-
factorily explained on the scholastic interpretation¹.
