among the five modes 01 this fallacy enumerated hy
Aristotlc, 000 10 10 form 001 distinguishable from the
legitimate Syllogisml. Selecting this variety, as that by
which most 01 011 the objection is to be sustnined, we
will proceed 10 examine its peculiarities.

In the first placo, it is manifestly necessary to a
Potitio 000010,οε the lallacy may more correctly be
called, that there should be a question proposed for
precs. And hence it was long ago acutely remarked hy
Petrus Hispanus, tlrat such a lallacy cannot be com-
mitted in a Syllcgism 01 inserencc'. lt, that is, the
truth 01 tho promises is known beforehand, and the only
question is, what may we infer from them? there is no
necessity lor bcyyiny or assumption 01 any kind. 11 10
clear than, that not the Syllogism in general, but at
most only one particular application 01 11, can heg the
question.

But it may be answered, that the truth 01 such promises
never can be ascertained, but by a previous inducticn
embracing all particular cases, and that Syllogistic in-
10000οε 10 therefore at least 101110, since the conclusion
drawn must be presumed to be already known. But
this answer 110011 assumes what has never yet been
satisfactorily proved, the dependente 01011 knowledge

01 Universals 00 1011001100. 11 axiomatic principles can
bc acquired in any other way, one class 01 Syllogisms is
at least exempt from the charge'.
