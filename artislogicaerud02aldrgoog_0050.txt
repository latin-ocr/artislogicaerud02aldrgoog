Amore formidabis assault was made in 1548 by Remus,1tamua.
vvho not only devoted a special worlr to the criticism cf
Aristotle⁸, but, adopting the dialectical and rhetorical
innovatione ol the earlier reformare, composed a new
system cl Logic in opposition to the Aristotelian. He
complains ol the want of a delinitiou of Logia iu
Aristotle, and treats it himself aa the Artos Dicaer-
tutiom its prineipal parts being lucentiore and Jadqment.
These he investigatos at length in his ,Dialecticoe In-
stitutione and Schola Dialectieca and in his Dic-
lectique‚ the earliest work on the subject in the Freneh
leuguage. Iuventium he treats chiefly rhetorically,
giving au account of arguments artificial and inartificial,
aud loci lor establishing them. Argumaat in Remus
denotas any term ola question, not, as in Cicero, the
middle. of Judqment he admits -three degrees‚ Axiom,
(proposition,) Syllogiam, and Method. In the earlier
editions of his Dialectic he admits the three Aristotelian
figures, but afterwards rejects the third. Each figure
has six monde, tvvo general (universal), trv‘o special (parti-
cular), and tvvo proper (singular). Method he divides
into Methcdue Dohtrr'nae, and Methcdna Prudentia. He
rejects, as extralogical, the Oategories, the Hermoneia,
and the Examination of Fallaciae. Remus, as may ba
seen even from the above cursory notice, introduced ,
many ueedlcss alterations in the lauguage of Logic.
In his logical innovatione, he is partly iudebted to
Rodolphus Agricola and Johannes sturmium aud, for
some of his attacks on the aristotelicus, to Valla and

Vives⁰.
