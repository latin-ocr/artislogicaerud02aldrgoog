the Loyica (Ιοοοοο and the Loyica otras, and the same
division had been made before by the Greek Com-
mentators, under the title of Logic without and with
application to thing's'. The former denotes Lugio in its
theoretical character, as concerned merely with the laws
and forms-oi thought, the latter is the practioal appli-
cetion of thought to this or that object matter. The
discrepancies in thc definition of Logia, as Science or
Art, may partly be traced ιο a confusion between these
two.

The Logica docear is properlya Soienoe and not an
Art. Itis not correct ιο say, as has frequently been
said or implied by modern Logicians‚ that every Science
is an Art, because all knowledge admits of a practical
application. “ The truth ie,'’ says Bentham, “ that how·
soerer clearly distinguishable in idea, the two objecto,
Art and Seianae, in themselves are not, in any instance,
found separate. In nn place is any thing to be duce,
but in the same place there is something ιο be known,-
in no place is any thing to be known, but in the same
place there is something to be done.’' The ternis thus
extended are too regne to be of any value, and tend to
confuse rather than ιο distinguish. Scienca is not Art,
though scientifio knowledge may be the basis oi artistic.
