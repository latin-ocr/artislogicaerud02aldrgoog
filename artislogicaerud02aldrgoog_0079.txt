hs does so iu the teeth oi Kant's demonstmtion, tbat a
oritetion of material truth is not only impossible, but
sels-contradictory. In attempting ιο eularge the field
of Logic, he only makes it impossible to assign ιο ir
any definite field whatever. If a single intruder is
admitted from the province ol material knowledge, no
borrier can he devised which shall not with cqual facility
gire access to all.

On this ground objections may be taken against the

view of another eminent English writer on Logic, whose
i work has attaiued ιο abigh and iu many respeets a well·
deserved reputation. According to Mr. Mill, Logic may
be defined as “ the scieuce of the operatious oi the un·
derstanding which are subservierit ιο the estimatiou oi

evidence: both the process itself of proceeding from
lrnown truths ιο unknown, and cll intellectuel operatione
auxiliary ιο this‘.'’ In accordsnce with this definition,
his treatise on Logic isbosed ou acombination of the
Old and the New Organ0n3 and the Baconiau rules for
the interrogation and interpretation of nature ere com·
hined with the Aristotelian principles oi the syllogism,
as part and parcel os the same sciense.

This definition appears as much too wide as that of
Archbishop Whntely is too narrow. The latter is open
ιο objection, because it excludes from the prosince oi
Logic processes of thought dependent upon precisely
the same laws, and subject ιο the same method oi
discovery and osiridem, ss that oi reasoning. The
present definition is open ιο objection, because it in·
eludes within the province of Legio prodesses goverued
by different lawa, involving fundamentally different me·
thods, aud implying essentially distinet conceptione,
united and confused by the ambiguities ol a common
lauguege.
