Blemmi- ie the Epitome Loyc'cu ol' Nicephorue Blemmidas, written
in the thirteenth century, which hasbeen quoted ea

mnemonioe which the schoolmen afterwards brought to
sueh perfection¹. The list ol Greek Logiciaue cloeee

script ot other Latin compendia similar in centenus to the stema, aud
haring the appearance ol disdnct translations trem the sarm angina
Το this must be added the testimony ol the Augnbrug MS. used by
Ehinger, (now at Munich,) which is inscribed τοῦ σοφωτάτου viator ele
ritu Ἀριστοτέλους λογικὴν ἐπιστήμην σύνοψις.

On the other hand it should be obaerved,

1⁰. That there is in the Bodleian Library (Cod. Mine. cclxxn l. tet. ο.)
a MS. mctibed dtr τῆι διαλεκτικῆς τοῦ Μιιΐστοιροι ntrpov τοῦ 'lemnii

find it to correspond exectly with the work published by Ehinger nuder
the name ol' Psellns. There ere also extant four other MSS. haring the
same title aad the earne beginning, (Διαλεκτική ἔστι τέχνη repeda rud
hortun barnaba) via. one at Florenee, (Bandini, vol. iia p. 111.) one
at Mudrid. (lriarte, vol. i. p. 276.) one et Vienna, (Lamban. vol. viii. p.
818.) and ene at Milan, (Alletiue apud Fabricium, Bibl. Graec. vol. xi. p.
³92. Harles.) Ol these the three last ere expressly ascribed to Scho-
larius aa the nausiator. A aixth MS. at Mosoorr with the caure title

able to ascertain any thing about ite contenta. ’

2⁰. It ie erident that the Anthor ot the Summulae was very ignorant ol
Greek. Hie derivationes Dialecttca, “A dic quod est duo, et topos qnod
est remo,rel lexic quod est rutio; quasi duorum sermo rel ratio,” could
hardly heve been made ογ a translator from the Greek Synopsis, where
the derivationiegiren correctly. ¹

8⁰. The only mnemonic which oceurs in the body ol the Greek Synopsie
is one lor the opponition of modale, expressed by the words, δουλούμενοι
herides σορνιισιόν ἐκτρίχουσι. The use of the diphthong would hardly heve
occurred to eu original writer, though naturally suggested by the purpurea,
illaec, curabimur, edentuli oi the Latin logiciun.

On the whole, the woight os evidence seems decidedly in favour ol the
opinion wtnch considere the Greek Synopsis to be a translation ol the
Summulre ol llispanua, probably rnade ογ Georgius schatanamerwarda
known ne Gennadius. ¹

For some ol the materiale ol thia note 1 arn indebted to a private
communicatiou sronr the late Sir W. Hamiltou, whose published opinion
has been referred to already.

¹ See St Hilaire, Mernor're, rol. ii.p. 160. lt may be questioned ulretlrer
the latin logiciae are indebtad to tlro Greek in this respect. See Sir
W. Hemilton's Discrurtons, p. 128, 671, and below, p. tt.
