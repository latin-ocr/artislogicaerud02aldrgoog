Scholastio Lugio, its very deficienoies render it in
' some respects preferable to a more faithful expo-

the merits of the mediaeval Philosophy; buthe
must be a bold champion of reaction who would
advocate the complete disinterment of the Lugio
of the Schools. Who would desire now to oppress “
the Student with the heavy burden of modalS, or
to bewilder him with the mysteries of Suppositio,
Ampliotio, Rostriett'o, and the whole farrago os the
Parva Logioalia? Omissions of this character
’ may, with equal probability and more charity, be
attributed to the sound judgment of the University,
than to the decline of the Professorial System and
the incompetency of College Tutors·.

On the other hand, it must be confessed that
there is much to be added to this or any other
Compendium, to enable it to meet the demands of
the existiug University Examinations. This will
at once be admitted by all who have had any
recent practice in tuition ; it may be easily ascer-
tained by any who will take the trouble of com·
paring the contents oi the book with those of
any of the present examination-papers. To this
deficiency, the increasing study oi the original
writings of Aristotle has not a little contributed.
