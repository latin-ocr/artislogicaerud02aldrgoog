Two names sanctioned by Aristotle are applicable ιο Names
parts, but to parts only,.of the Organon. These οιοῖἕέιέἦθ

Analytt'e and Dialeotio. The former term is applied by ΑοοΙγιιο.
Aristotle ιο the four books which treet oi the syllogisrn
and oi demonstration¹‚ and appears to denote the reso-
lution oi the reasoning process into its scientific forms.
This word ia the most nearly synonymous with the
modern Lcyic oi any used by Aristotla himself 3 but it
embraoes the process of Reasoning only, to the exclusion
ol Conception and Judgmentk. Dialeotio is a word pro· Dialeotio.
bably invented by Plato¹‚ though afterwards applied to
the worlrs of earlier philosopham, e. g. Zeno the Eleatic.
In its Platonic senae it denoted the highest oi all
soienoes3 that which· talres cognisanoe of the. eternal
end immutabis, of being in general and its attributes,
aud thus has insigbt into the universal principles upon
which all other knowledge is dependente. Ιι thus
corresponds in matter, though different in form, with
the first Philosophy or Theology ol Aristotle, afterwards
called Metaphysies. ¹'I'he name Dialeotio had reference

l Galen (de libris propriis, ch. ll.) says that the title Anclytieais not
Aristoteliam the Prior analytice being called by their author περὶ συλλο-
γισμοῦ, and the Posterior, sepi decederes. This testimony is accepted by
M. St. Hilaire, Μεηιοὶνο, p. te. But the name ιναλυτικὰ neema too
hequeutly iu Aristrtle's own writirrgs to wanant this view, unless we
suppose ( which is very improbable) that all the references have been
interpolated hya later hand. Ol. Waltz, rol. i. p. 367. The disfinetion,
however, between Prior aad Posterior Analyties is not recognised by
Aristotle, aud we may perhaps conjecture that the name ducamini was
given by him tu the entire four books, each dirision being also distin·
guished by its own title, as mentioned hy Galen.
