minds possessed of certain additional knowledge, he an
indication of the other; hut the true ground of the
inference is contained in this additional knowledge, end
notin the mero hypothetioel coupling of the scote by
e conjunctien. This is not hypothetical reescning3
i. e. it is not ressoning from tte hypothecis, bnt from
other circumstances not mentioned in the hypothesis

It thus appears, thet the only hypotheticel jndgment
which cen he employed es the resi mejor promise of
a syllogism, moy be expressed in the form, “ lf any Α
is B, it is 0,” where A, Β, end (l represent concepte or
general notione. The complete cetegoricel equivalent
to this is, “Every A which is B is Ο, because it is B,”
which admits of two interpretatione, according ss B
. stende ior the physicel ccuse of the fact, cr for the
logiosl reason of our knowing it. In the 'latter cese,
the jndgment is anslytical, and represents e disgnised

formul consequence with B es e middle term: e. g.

¹¹ This msy be mede clesrer by sn exemple- The following is cited by
Prisc, cs an instance ol s hypotheticsl proposition, not reducible to catc-
goricsl form. ‘¹ lt Cuius is free from business, he is writing poetry.'' This
may be interpreted to mean either, generally, ‘¹ whenerer Csina is dis·
engaged, he writes poetry ;'' or, specielly, ‘⁴ it he is now disengsged, he is
now writing poetry.” Under the former interpretation, it is s general
hypothesis, which msybe appliedassmrg‘or premisetopsrticulsr instences:
but in this csse the true t'orrn of the ressoning is, ⁴¹ All times when (teins
isdisengeged, sre times when he writes postus end the present is such
e time.” Under the letter interpretation, it is one os the ceses ci s
materici connection oi two secte mentioned in the text. Now in this
last csse, itis obvious thet tbe inferente is really mede, nothum the
hypothesis, bnt from some circumstance known to the reesoner, bnt not
eppesring in the proposition. Any men being esked, “Why do you inser
tbst Caius, being now disengeged, is writing poetry?” would reply‚
“Because he told me he should do so;'' or something ol the kind.
Assrrredly he would never dream oi replying‚ ⁸⁶ Because ishe is now
disengaged he is writing.'’ In this cese then he does not resson srcm
tte hypothesis, end the expresssd propositione do not compose a syl-
logism.
