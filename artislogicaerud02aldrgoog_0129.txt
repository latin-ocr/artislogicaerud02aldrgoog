¹ Accidental definition is composed of genus and one or
more propertirs. Accidents properly so called are expressly
rejected as useless in definition by Porphyry, Isag. 3. 15. and
by Boethius, Opera, p. 3, though admitted by some subsequent
authorities. Hence animal risibile would be a better example
than Aldrich’e animal bipes implume. But the majority of
Logieieus have very properly regarded occidental definition,
in any surm. es no definitior, but merely description. It does
not anelyse the contente of a notice, but enumeratos marks
by which one individucl may be distinguished from each other.
The same notion can have but one definitam the same indi-
vidual may have many recepticio. cf. Albert. 1. 6. Oecam,
pt i. ch. 27. Wyttenbseh. Precept. Lep. p. iii. c. v. ξ. 14.

· Metaphysicel delinition¹ the only proper definition 'm the
strict sense ol the term, being by genus and differentia, (or
more eorrectly by genus and diffamatia: see Top. i. 8, 3.
and above, p. 26, note s.) it will follow, that all definable
notione must be speeies Hence summa perere, which have no
differentius, and individuale, which are distinguished only by
accidente, are not definable. See Arist. Metaph. iv. 3, θ.
(where lor 616 read ot, supported by two Mes. and by Alexander.
Schol. p. 698, a. 8.) vi. lb. 2. The supposed differente on this
point between Aristotle and Locha, or rather Descartes, may
be reduced to a verbal question. See Appendix. note G.
