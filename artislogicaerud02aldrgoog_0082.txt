ness are never met with in practice. On the other harrd,
the Buconian Legio, lihe the subordinate brenches of
physioal science, is constructed ὰ posteriori from the
obserred uniformities of nature3 arrd its principles and
conclusions are true primarily cf the facts as they exist
in nature, secondarily only ol our conceptione, so iar as
they are accurate representatione of the facts. Hence
the truth of the system entirely depends on the real
existence of the objeots of which it treats; end the
whole fabric would fall ιο the ground if the objects were
annihilated or their constitution reversed· Hence ιοο a
conception not in accordanoe with facts is worse than
useless: is it is not the representation of nature as itis,
it cannot claim to be accepted as the representation of
nature as it should be.

An error of this sort becomes serious in its con·
sequenoes. Itis agreetmistalre ιο treet vannus dell·
nitione oi Legio as mere matters of opinion, in which
each person is st liberty to expand or contract the
boundaries of the science according to his own leading
conception. The whole province of the practice of
reasoning may be affected by an error in its theory. For
example. A writer who treats the Orgenon of Aristotle'
and the Orgsnon of Bacon as parts of the same system
is in consistenoy obliged to regerd the so·cellcd lews
oi thought es being in reality laws ol external nature⁰;
and the same obligation extende to all cognate branches

·rhus hir. hlill (beytr, vol. i. p. test observes: “So long as what
vere termed Universels were regarded as apeculiar kind ol substantes,
having an chective existence distinct from the individual objects classed
under tham, the dictum de omni couroyed en importent meaning; because
it expressed tlte interocmmunity ol nature, which ir was necessary upon
thet theory that ne should suppose ιο exist between those general snb·
stances and the particular substantes which nere subordinated to tlrem.
Thst every thing predicable ol the universal was predicable ol the various
individuale contained under it, rrae then no identical proposition, bnt a
statement cl what aas oonoaired es alandamcntal lan ol the universe.”
