by Burgersdyck Itur. Lag. l. ii. c. l.r “Mens nostra qua·
drnplici delectu laborat, cum occupata est in investiganda
rerum cognitione: vel enim non assequitur proposita rei
essentiam, sed circa illius accidentia solum haeret ac sensi·
biles notas; vel essentiam rei confuse tantum concipit, et
ratione minime distincta; vel in dubiis non reperit quid
statuat, aut etiam statuit quodfalsum est; vel denique non
servat ordinem in commentando, qui cum 'natura rerum
consentit. Hisce quatuor malis opponit Logica totidem
remedia. Definitio exhibet menti essentiam rerum: divisio
efficit cognitionem distinctam: syllogismus tollit animi
incertitudinem et errorem circa themata complexa: methodus
ἀταξίαν sive contusionem.'' Hence it appears that falsity ol
judgment simply was not regarded as remediable by Logic,
but only salsity in relation to the syllogism‚ i. e. so lar as it
depends on the assumed truth or falsity of other judgments.
But the above statement requires considerable limitation.
Every process ol thought is liable to asemel deiect, as
violating its own laws, and to a mammet deiect, as inconsistent
with experience. Thus a concept may be obscure or indis·
tiuct formally, as implying attributes which cannot be thought
in conjunction, as when its different parts contradict one
another: a judgment may be formally false, lor the same
reason: and a reasoning may be formally inconsequent, as
nansgressing the lawe oi the syllogism. In all these cases
the lauit may be detected by Logic. On the other hand. a
concept may be materially obscure or indistinot¹ as containing
attributes which we have never met with in our own expe·
rienes: ajudgment may be materially false, as being at
rariance with laets: a reasoning may be materially incon·
sequent, as not warranted by the lawe or analogias ol nature.
In all these cases, the fault can only be detected and reme·
died by experience. cf. Prolepomeno Βορέω, p. 288, (and ed.
p. aot.)
