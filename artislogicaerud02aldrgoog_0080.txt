ln the lirst place: the purpose of the Aristotelian
Logio is ιο investigate the lawe under which the subject
thinlrs3 the purpose of the Btaconian Logio is to inves-
tigata the laws under which the phenomena of the object
take place‘. 'lhey ere thus respectively occupied with
the two opposita poles of human knowledge, the epo and
tha non epo. 'I'he questions os the former are to be an·

, swered by an examination oi the interna] consciousness 3

the questions oi the latter by au examinatiou oi external

nature. Tha two systema are thus diametrieally opposed
to each other in their ch'ectr. In the second place: the
Aristotelian laws are luws of thought aa it onpltt to hc.
The Baconian lawa are lawa of nature aa it ie. The
former are principles testing upon their own evidence;

certain d priori as lawa, whether actually complied with or
not3 approving themselves to consciousness'the instent
they are enunciated 3 and irreversihle in thought, because
thought itsell is under their control. The latter are lawa
testing upon the evidence οἱ the facts to which they relate;
valid only in so far aa they are actually complied with3
and ceasing to he laws at all, the instant that an ex·
ception to thern is discovered. And, however universally
true in nature, they are always reversihle in thought; ·
sor prior to their discovery we had uo reason ιο think oi
thern at all, aud afterwards we have only ιο discard an
adventitious knowledge. The two systems are thus dis-
tinct in their evidence ,· the opposite of the one being the
mentally inoonceivable, that of tha other the physically
impossible. Iu the third place: in the applications of
the. Aristotelian Logia vve proceed from the law to the
lacta, constructiug types of reasoning according to given
principles, and accepting or rejecting all actual cases,
according as they do or do not exemplify the law. ln
the applicatione of the Baconian Logic we proceed sroru
