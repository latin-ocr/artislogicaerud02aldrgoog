envy hete :'' the latter ie -s maguler Proposition, whieh
however is not regarded ¹os a sign, exeept relatively to
some other proposition, whioh it is supposed may be
inserted from it. The εἰκός, when employed in au
Enthymeme, will form the major promise of a Syllogiem
suoh ss the following:

Most men who envy hate.

'I'hie men eunies,
Therofore, 'l'hie man (probably) batos.

The reasoning is logioally faulty3 ior, the major promise
not being absolutely universal, the middle term is not

distributed.
The σημεῖον will form one promise ol a Syllogism whioh

moy be in suy ol the three ligures, as in the following

examplee:

Fig. l. Fig. 2.
All ambitione men ere liberal; All pregunnt women are pale,
Pittacus ie ambitibus (a), This women is pale, (Σ),
Therelore, Pittacus is liberal. Therelore‚ She is pregusut

Fig. 8.
Pitteous is good (ΣΥ,
Pitteous is wiee,
Therelore, All wiee meu are good.

⁸ ln the ilret end eeoond ligures, the σημεῖον ie oloarly the adeor
premise; this alone being singlrlar. In the third, ae lar aa quantity ie
oouoernsd, we may ohooee between both promises. 1t seems more natural
however to preler the msp'on because, in assigning asemon sor our heliel
in a giem proposition, we should naturally elate apremise haring either
the seme predicate or the same subject ,- not ouo iu rrhioh the prodiente ol
the promise is the subject ol the oonolueion. For example: why do yon
believe Pittacus to he liberal? Beoause he is nubitious. why do you
believe riae men lo be geodt Beoanse Pittaous is good. This ie lar more
natural thau to euenor, “Beoanse Pittaous is niso:¹ The same oon·
sideratiou will brruish the data lor interpreting an obseura passage iu
sumpsisset. ehieh however it would exoeed my present limite to
attempt 'I'he render will flod it rightly explained in s note to St. Hilaire's
Treueladon, vol. ii. p. etl. with the exeeptiou that the syllogism may he
more olesrly eund in desere than in Gemestres.
