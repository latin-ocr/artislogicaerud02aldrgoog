Between Scotus and Occam comes in order of timeRaymond
the most eccentric genius of the scholastic period, Ιὶειγ-ῙΜΗ]Ι
mend Lully. Hc is principally known es the author of
the Are Meync, by which he professed to teach a man
ignorant eren oi letters the whole encyclopaedia in the
course of three months. This work is nominelly logical,
but hus little in common with thc Aristotelicu Logic,
being principally e mechanical contrivancc t‘cr connect-
ing different philosophicel terms with each other·. But
in bis Dialectice, Lully condescende to follow the
beaten trech, and has composed c clear and concise
synopsis of Logic, framed principally on that cf Petrus
Hispanus¹.

'Ibe writings of Occem, as well as those oi Scotus, con·
tributed especially to rcise Logic to the renlr of a distinct
science, independent of its applied uses0. But they
approached it from opposite sides· The principles of
Occam, developed by modern philosophy, would lead us
to the Logic of Kant: those of Scotus, almost to the
Logic os Hegel. The seleuce of the former would
ecquire e clear and distinct object in the province ot
Thought: thet of the latter would gradually absorb all

else, as coextensire with Being. Occam is the last great {iffi

men.
