end therefore it will not be true thet No A is B; which was
the original proposition. Aristode does not assume the con·
version of l to prove that of E, which would be erguing in a
circle. For a fuller account see Hemilton on Reid, p. 696.

Alexander himself offers a third proof by syllogism in the
first figure. No A is B, therefore No Β ie A; for suppose
“SomeBisA‚”and“NoAisB‚''.·.SomeBisnotB.
· Having proved the couversion of E, those of A end 1 will
follow from it “All Ais Β, therefore Some Β is A ;’' or else
No Β is A, and therefore (by conversion) No A is B; whereas
we assumed All A is B. And again, Some A is B,·therefore
SomeBisA ; or else NoBis A, and therefore NoAis Β.

For these proofs, the only assumption necessary is tha
principle of contradiction. But proof of any kind is super·
fluous. (lonversion end other immediate inferences aro

and more direct theotho mediate inferences hy syllogism.
