ΟΝ THE Erroruurrcsr. sruaoelsu.

Tunr the συλλογισμοὶ ἔξ ὑποθέσεως of Aristotle are not
identioel with those which, since the time of Theophrastus
and Eudemus, heve been received in Logie es Hypothe-
tieel *Syllogisma is now generally admitted⁸. The word
Hypothetioal ie never by Aristotle opposed to Cote-
porieol, but to. ostensive (tammam end he remarks thet
the Spllopistie portion of the reasoning in Hypothetioal
Syllogisms is ostensive, and requires no reduction3 but
that the determination of the original question is not
effeeted by Syllogism at all, and cannot be exhibited in
Syllogistio form. The meaning of this may be oleerly
explained by examples.

Of the H ypothetioal Syllogism‚ tvvo prinoipal kinds are
mentioned by Aristotle. Oue is the ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς τὸ ethere:
theotherisaSyllogismofwhiehtheeonolusivenessdepends
entirely on agreement between two oontending parties,
and which is therefore chiefly servieeeble in dialectis
disputation. The letter may be exhibited as follows.

The original question being to prove that some Ais ¹
not B; the oontending parties agree ιο the hypothesis,
that if some A is not Ο, ἰι is not B. The reesoning
proeeeds thus:

No X is 0;
All X is Α; (συλλογισμὸς ἐξ ὑποθέσεως.)

Therelore‚ Some Α is not C.

¹ We must except M. St. Hilahe, who professes to discover the ordinary
Hypothetioels in Anu. Prior. i. 44. l. But the text of Aristotle will hardly
verrent the assertion. cf. Sir W. Herbitam, Ducentem, p. loa, md Ed.)
Lectum on Lepte, ii. p. 387. Iu the latter pleae, Sir W. Hamilton notiees
thet Aristotle hes himself described the process ol reesoniug commonly
enlled hypothetieel‚ hut denies it to he e syllogism. See Anni. Pr. i. ³2. 7.
b See Auel. Pr. i. 23. 2.
