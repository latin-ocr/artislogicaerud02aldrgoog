On tho other band, the Examplo bas a strictly logical
valuc, when it is used, not as an independent reasoning,
but as an answar to objections. Thus it does uot loqieclly
follow, because A andB araboth X, and A is Y,tbatB is
also Y. But the union of Xaninn the instance of A
bpioclly proves that X and Y aro not incompatible with
each otber3 that cne X at least is Y; and therefore that the
two attributes may coexist in the same subject Hence
tbe Examplo is logically ralid against any reasoner who
maintains theta thing cannot be Y, because it ic X. But,
in this case, the conclusion is not assertorial, “B c Y,”
but only problematioal, “B may de Y.”

The Examplo is sometimes loosely called reasoning
from Anclcqyss. This term, however, properly belongs
not ιο absolute similarity in any given quality, but only
to similarity os relations. Thus Aristctle speaks ol an
cnchryy between sight and intellect‚ the one being re·
lated ιο the body as the other ιο the south. And the
argument of Bishop Butler's Analoyy os Reliyicn to tlte
Comtitutica arrd Ccurre of Nature may bc put into tbc
same form. The difficulties in Religion, natural and
revealed, have tho samo relation to their respective
systems, that the difficulties in tha course of nature have
ιο the entire system cf nature. If then the latter be
admitted to prooeed from a Divina Author, the diffi-
culties in the two former are not a valid objectiou
against a lilse origin. This reasoning hum Analogy
corresponds to what is sometimes called the Induc-
ticn ol Socrates, and to the παραβολὴ mentioued in
Aristotle’s Rhetoric¹. Like the Examplo proper, it
