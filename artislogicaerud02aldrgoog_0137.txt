¹²¹ This, and the greater part oi the scholastic memorial
verses, arc found for thc first time in the Stemmata Locieales
of Petrus Hispanus, afterwards Popc John XXI. who died in
latr. He does not, however, profess to be the author ol
them; indeed some, including the presentare also noticed
by his contemporary Aquinas, as established mnemonics. In
slight measure he has been anticipated by the Greeks. A
mnemonic lor the opposition cl modale is found in the synopsis
attributed to Psellus‚ and one for the syllogistic moods in
Nicephorus Blemmides. But the genuineness of that portion
of the worhs oi Aquinas has been questioned, and the hachac .
which goes under the namo of Psellus is probably a transla-
tion of the Summulac os Hispanus. The latter work is thus
our earliest undoubted authority ior these curicus specimans
of scholastic ingenuity. ‘See below, p. 84. note z.

¹¹ This is argued at some length in a thesis appended to
Wallis's Logic ς and is, to say the least, by iar the most con-
venient way of bringing singular propositione under the
existing rulcs of the syllogism. At the same time it may bc
remarlred that the employment of singular terma as predicatcs
is tinnatural, and the reasoniug‚ at least in affirmativa syl·
logisms‚ worthless. See An. Pr. i. tt. 3. Indead it may bc
questioned whether the ἔκθεσις of Aristotlc (see below, p. 61.) .
was regarded by him as a syllogism at all. Gi. Aquinas,
