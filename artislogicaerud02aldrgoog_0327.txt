“ Every man who is learned has erudiet, beeauae he
is leamed.” Here the notion ol study is implied in
thet ol learning, and the major premise is, “ All learned
beings have studied.” The hypothetioal proposition
thus becomes a complete syllogism‚ to whieh the sub-
sequent eonsequenee is related es an episyllogism’. ln
the former ease, where B stands for a physioal oause,
the judgment is synthetieal, and indicates a material
oonsequenoe, whioh it requires some additional know-
ledge of laets to reduoe ιο formal: e. g. “All wax
exposed ιο the lire melts, beeause it is exposed.” Here,
on material grounds, we know that we oannot supply the
presules, “ All bodies exposed to the lire melt;” but
only, “All bodies soluble by hest and exposed ιο the
lire melt.’' In this osse the consequence is extralogioal,
and requires additional data not giren in the thought.
But here also, when the judgment in question is ern·
ployed as the premise of a reasoning‚ the oonolusion
follows categorieally3 though the promise itself cannot,
as it stands, be proved by a prosyllogismr.

The Disjunotire Judgment is usually deseribed as
representing a whole divided into two or more parts
mutuslly exclusive of eaeh other3 and the Disjuuotire
