As regards Formal or Logical Fallaciae, a fuller ex·
planetiou may be needed. The ultimate test oi tha
logioal validity of any thought is emeioubility. Tbis
test may be applied to judgments and reasonings, as
well as to concepta. Α concept is logically real if it is
conceivable; that is to say, if its constituent parts can be
combined with eacb other in an unity of representation.
lt it complice with this criteriou, it is real as a thought:
whether its supposed object be real as a thing, isa
question with which Legio has no concern. A judgmeut,
again, is logically true or necessary, (for Logic rcoognises
no truth short of necessity,) if its contradictory is inccn-
coirable: it is logically false or impossible, if it is itself
inconoeirable ; but if two contradictory assertione are
both equally conceivable, it does not lie within the pro·
vince of Logic to determine their truth or falsehood. A
reasoning, in like manner, is logically necessary, it the
contradictory of the conclusion cannot be eouoeired as
true, consistently with the assumed trutb of the premises:
it is logicelly impossible, it the conclusion itself cannot
be so conceived. lt, however, the conclusion aud its
contradictory are equally conceivable along with the
assumed truth of the premises, the conclusion may or
may not have a material ralue, but itis one which cannot
be recognised by Lugio.

But though tbe test of conceivability is thus applicable
to judgments and reascuings, as well as to concepta, it is
applieuble ina different manner. Α given combination
of attributes may be inconceivablc, eitber because it
contains too little, or because it contains too much.
Tbat is to say, it may either be defective in tho con·
ditione under which alone attributes can ba united in

representation, or it may contein such attributes as
mutually exclude one another. Thus, inasmuoh cs unity

ol representation is only possible under the condition
