Conversion hy contraposition, which is not employed
by Aristotle, is given by Boethius in his first hook, De
Syllogtirmo Cataporico. He is followed by·Petrus Hispanus,
who first gives the mnemonic, as above. It should be ob-
served, diac the old Logicians, following Boethius, main·

the others, the quality should remain unchanged. (ion-
sequently the converse of “ All A is B¹' is “All not B is
not A,'' and of “Some A is not B.'' “Some not B is not
not A.'' Itis simpler, however, to convert A into Ε and 0
into I, (⁴¹ No notBisA;” “Some notBis A,'')osis done by
Wallis and Abp. Whately; and before Boethius by Apuleius
and Capella, who notice the conversion, but do not give ita
name. The principle of this conversion may be found in
Aristode, Top. ii. 8. l. though he does not employ it for
logical purposes.
