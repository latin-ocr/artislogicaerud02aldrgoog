A few words in nouolusion on the origin of the neme
Enthymeme. 'l'hst its etymology is ιο be found in b
end onte, is undenisble; but only in the usne degree ss
is else true of Μιμεῖσθαι, birinus, end other eognste terme.
But thet it hss no speoisl referenoe to s promise ἑο the
mind, is evident3 first, because θυμὸς in the Aristotelian
phrsseology is not “ the mind,’' nnd hss nothing ιο do
with the expressiones suppression of premisse: seoondly,
beoeuse tbe word Μῦμημα oeours in writers earlier thsn
Aristode, snd before it oould bose sssurned its teohnioel
meaning. To ssoertsin the true derisorios, however, is
not so essy ss ιο refute n pelpebly absurd one. If,
however, we were compelled ιο melre s suggestion, the
following, though not ooufldently put forwnrd, hes st ·
lenst tbe merit of not being positively ridioulous. Ae·
eording ιο the snelogy of words of the sume terminetion,
such ss ostendentes, ἐπιχείρημα, σόφισμα, &e ἐνθύμημα will
properly signify the result of eu sot of reflection¹. Hense
it is used by Sopbooles for s thought suggested by n person
or thing0, end by Xenophon Ρ, for splen designed, opposed
ιο leyen, tle execution. The term is thns naturally enough
epplioeble to the aggestione or persuasioe arguments of
Rhetorio, ss distinguished from the demonstratione of
Seienoe.
