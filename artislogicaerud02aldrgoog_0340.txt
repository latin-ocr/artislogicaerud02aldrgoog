-The question, why a reotilinear figure of three sides, be
it called triengle or not, has its angles equel to two
' right angles, remeius unanswered.

Seeondly. lf geometrioal reasoning is merely “the

logieal filiation of oonsequenoes whioh follow from an
assumed hypothesis‚” there is no reason why its oon-

olusions should be more important then those of any
other auelysis of imaginary notione, suoh as (to use
Mr. Mill’s illustration) e deduction of the physiologioel
properties of an imaginary animal, or the politionl
history of an imaginery eommouwealth. The whole
oharaoter and history of mathematica] soienoe militetes
against the admissiou of this consequence.

ΙΙ. Mr. Mill, while agresing with Stewert that mathe-
matioal neeessity is merely hypothetieal and eonse-
quenriel, saw olearly that Stewart’s doctrine oonoerning
Definitions was untenable. This led him to adopt the
seoond theory, aooording to whieh geometrioal inferentes
depend on Posteriores assuming the existence of the
objeots defined. Thus a triangle has its anglos equal
to two right angles, because there may really exist a
reotilinear figure liaving three sides; and this existence
is implied, though not verbally expressed, in the defi-
nition.

This theory derives some apparent support from the
use oi the prinoiple of superposition. When, for instenoe,
the demonstrationi of the fourth proposition of Euolid
supposes the triangle AB G to be epplied to the trinugle
D E F, it olesrly assumes the existence of both triangles,
not merely as general notions, whioh ere identieel in
thought, but as distinet individual maguitudes, oooupy-
ing spaoe, and onpable of being transferred from one
position in spaee to another. One non-entity oannot be

de tout anuo sens, s'il en a, pour n'aroir plus que oelni auquel on le
destino uniqnement.”
