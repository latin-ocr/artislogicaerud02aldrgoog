may thus be hypothetieally combined into a single
truth3 and this⁴ combination cannot be reduced into
categorical lormss. The Hypotheticel Syllogism, in like
manner, is a form of reasoning distinct from the (late-
gorieal and not reducible to it, being based ou a different
law of thought, namely, tha Logieal Principle oi Sufficient
Reasou, c ratione ad ratiouatum, a nepotiane rationali od
negationem rationis valet consequentior.

Of this principle, us applied to judgments,l bave
elsewhere remarlred, that it is not a law of thought, but
only a statement of the necessity of some law or other¹.
As applied to syllogisms, it has the sume character. lt
states, generally, that whenever a condition, whether
material cause of a fact or formal reason oi a conclusion,
existe, the conditioned fact or conclusion existe also.
Thus riewed, it is not the law oi any distinct reasoning
process, buta statement of the conditione in which laws
ot' nature or oi thought ere operative. When a material
eausa exista, its material effect follows, and the pheno-
menou indicates alaw ol nature: when alogical premise
is given, its logical conclusion follows, aud the result
indicates a law of thought. Wtar law, must in each
case be determined by the particular features 01ι tbe
phenomenon or reasoning in question3 but a statement
of this kind is distinguished from lawe of thought,
properly so called, by the fact, that it cannot be ex-
pressed in a symboliaal form: we require the introduction
of a definite notion, Caute, Baeton, Condition, or some-
thing οἱ tha lrind, which is a special object of thought,
not the general representative os all objeets whatever.
The principle in questionis thus only a statement oi
