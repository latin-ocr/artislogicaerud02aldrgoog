cre made to depeud cn ι supposed inflation of the
sphera. Here ie another implied postulate or axiom.
“A hard body may be increased or diminished in sizo
to any extent without losing its hardness.’' Empiricelly,
this is nntrue. A body which resiste all change of form
cannot in practice be expanded or eontraoted aa libitum.
To assume it as imaginably true is ιο assume ιιι axicm,
not a definition.

Again: the author attempta to prore tho majority of
the axioma of Euclid by superposition3 laying down
besoreband these two definitions; “ Things which occupy
the same place, are said to coincido ;'’ and “ Magnitudcs
which, if their boundaries were applied to one another,
would coincide, or might be made capable of doing so
bya different arrangement of parts, are called equal.''
Iu the letter definitionagain there is an assumed postu·
late: “ The parts of a body may be arranged in any way,
without affecting the magnitude of the body.” Otherwise
the two meanings ci the term opaciore a mere equi-
vocation; and tho demonstration¹ oi the equality oi any
two given bodies is a mere play upon words. Ais equal
to B because it actually coincides with it. O is equal to
B because it moy be made to coincide with it. But how
do 1 know that it is the rome C before and after the
change in the arrangement oi its parts? li 1 may essert
that the two bodies are coto aquai, because a different
arrangement of parte may make them so, why may Ι not
essert that they ere acro aquai, because by taking away a
part of one of them they may become so?

But eren after this assumption is mede, it may be
questioned whether the principle oi superposition can
be legitimotely applied to magnitudes considered as
exhibited on a hard body. Magnitudes in space can be
constructed c priori in a pure intuition, and in any one
part of space, as readily ae inanv other. Hence they
