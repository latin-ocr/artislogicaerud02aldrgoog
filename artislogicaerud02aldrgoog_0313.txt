ΟΝ EXAMPLE snb attamen.

Excussa is defined by Aristotle, “ proving the mejor
term oi the middle by e term resembling the minor·.”
This definiticn is obscure, from being worded so as to
contraet with his definition of induction, in which the
mejor tenu is proved of the middle by the minor. lt
does not apply to the singular conclusion ultimately
established, but to the universal proposition which forms
the conclusion oi the inductive portion of the Exemplo.
Thus, if we expand Aristotle’s instance into ite complete
form, composed ci an imperfect induction end e syllo-
gism, it will run thus=

The war cl the Thebans and Phocians (D) was en
evil (A),
The wer of the Thebans and Phocione was a wer between
neighbours (Β),
All were between neighbours cre evil.
A wer between the Atheniens and Thebans (G) is a war
between neighbours.
It is an evil.

In this reasoning there are four terme, A the major, B the
middle, (l the minor, D the ὁμοῖον. The definition applies
to the third proposition, in which Α is proved of B by
meane oi D. If the final conclusion were tehen into
account, the Exemplo might be more correctly defined
es a reeeoning in which the major term is proved of the
minor by means of e middle, of which middle the major
hasbeen proved by aterni resembling the minor.
