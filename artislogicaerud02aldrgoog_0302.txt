predicates3 if they have the sams predicate, we must
compare their subjecta.

According to this method, it will be seen, that in the
first figure, the predicate of the sign is ιο that of its
conclusion as part ιο whole, or as species to genus.
Hence its logical validity: whatever subject is included
nuder a species is necessarily included under its genus.
But in the second figure the relation is that of whole to
part, or of genus to species3 and this is' illogical, the
whole genus not being included under one of its species.

But if we adopt the second interpretation, and compare
the majorpremisc with the conclusion, wc shall he corn·
pellcd in the first figure to compare together the two
subiecta since both propositione have the same predicate.
In this case the relation will be inverted3 the promise
being ιο the conclusion as an universal rulc to a single
instance. In the second figure, we are at liberty to
compare either the quantity of the two propositione aa
determined by their subjecte, or the extentos their
respective predicates. In either case, however, the result
is the same; the relation remaining that of universal ιο
particular.

The Enthymems in the third figure presente no diffi-
culty. Whiohever interpretation be adopted, the saruc
proposition, “Pittacus is good,’' is compared with the
conclusion, “ All wisc mon are good.'' In both cases,
the comparisou lies between the two subjecte, and the
relation is that of particular to universal.

But perhaps the most difficult passage in this portion
of the Rhetoric is that in which Aristotle describes an
important, and previously, as he tells us, unnoticed
distinction between various classes of Enthymemes.
Some ol these, he says, belong ιο Rhetoric, some to
other arte and facultics. The same may be said of the
connexion of the Syllogism with Dialectic. Dialectical
