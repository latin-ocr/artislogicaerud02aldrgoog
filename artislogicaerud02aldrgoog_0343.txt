lt may be true that the image wbieh gives rise to the
intuitive perception oi the axium, is not oonseiously
oontemplated as more perleot than the eorresponding
figure aa seen in abody; but this does not prove that
the axiom is really generalised from the latter·. The
inadequaoy oi sensible magnitudes for mathematioal
eertainty does not arise froin that ot‘ whieb we are
immediately consolaus, but from that oi which we are
not. The straight line aa pereeived is a quality of body;
tha straight line as imagined is a modification oi space.
The portione of the two actually presented at any time
may not apparently differ lrom eaah other 3 but our
empirioal knowledge or ignoranee oi body may suggest
aetual or possible variations not pereeired in the in-
tuition3 ior the qualities oi body have an objeetive
existence independently oi our perception, and therefore
mayor may nothe adequately peroeived at any one
time. We see, for example, that a line running along
the eartb‘s surlaae is apparently straight; but we know
that it is in reality an aro ol the earth’s eurvature, and

ι might be seen to ba so in another position or with more

acute organa. But the straight line in spaee existe only
aa imagined, and is imagined only as mathematieally
exaot. The intuition, therefore, is adequate'and valid
for any extent of spaee, and in any portion. The
apparent straightness of the risible line is the resultes
an imperleeuon iu our bodily organs3 and with more
aeute sensas we might peroeive its deviation. The
presented straightuess of the imaginary line results from
the exaemess of our eonsuuetira power; and a superior
