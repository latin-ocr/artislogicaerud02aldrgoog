two perfect straight lines, those lines cannot enclose
a space; andis there existe any where a figure formed by
three such lines, it has its angles aquai to two right
angles. But this supposed existence of the objects
cannot be verifled by any process of mathematical
reasoning. Το bridge over the ohasm which separatas
thoughts from things ; to determine how far a subjective
necessity of thinking indicates a corresponding objective
necessity oi existence, is the office, not of-‚Mathematica
bnt of a Sciencc of Being, of Metaphysios, or, as Plato
would say, of Dialectic.

But though objective existence is beyond the province
of the mathematician, there is a further condition of
subjective existence, which he is bound ιο verify ior
himself, by sn appeel to pare inmitium i. e. by con·
structing in his mind sn image corresponding to each
assumed conception. As sar as mere nomenclatura is
concamed, we might employ the term hianple ιο denote
a rectilinear figure of two sides, or the term Mcentrient
circle to denote a figure in which all straight lines drawn
from two interior points ιο the circumference are equa]
to each other. There is no logical contradiction in
such definitions3 and those who maintain that all
mathematical certainty depende on experience, are
bound in consistenoy to admit that these.conceptions
are no more absurd than those oi a cantant ora hippo·
gryph; representing objecta no otherwise inconceivable
than that experience has shewn them ιο have no real
existence.

Hence it follows, that no expression in Geometry
which combines together a plurality oi attributes can be
regarded as epure definition. For the assumption that
such attributes can coexist in an image or figure is either
demonstrabis or indemonstrable. In the former case
the definition is coupled with a theorem, in the latter
